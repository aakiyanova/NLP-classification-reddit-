2,Start centipawn rating?,chess,"I have been looking at some of Nakamura's videos recently, and I have noticed that he uses a software to evaluate the board position, I am assuming that the numbers displayed are centipawn ratings according to some engine (which one, by the way?).

I was wondering, why does the rating start at +0? Is this because...

1. The rating is *normalised* to start at +0 by definition? That it is, it was hard-coded by whoever programmed the engine.

2. It is not hard-coded in any way, but effectively a conclusion that the engine comes to independently, effectively as an estimate that, with perfect play, the game is expected to end in a draw?

3. Something else entirely?

I imagine this would be engine-dependent, i.e. for alphazero the answer would have to be (2)... if alphazero does indeed estimate a +0 at game start.",1610544449

13,Do most people actually lack the discipline to improve?,chess,"Let's start with myself; If I look back at my own history I had the plans and books many years ago but my improvement is WAY slower than I imagined. If I had put all those time browsing Reddit and the internet about chess in to actually studying chess...

When I browse the chessdotcom forums about improvement and/or books from 3-5 years ago I sometimes check the user profiles that gave the advice or had the plans and most of the time their rating is still super low. Like they haven't improved at all. This seems the rule rather than the exception.

I wonder if chess improvement is actually way harder than some people make it be (anyone can get to 1800 with some tactics) simply because we lack the discipline.

I understand it’s a Lesson example but since this is teaching you how to play the game it shouldn’t be teaching you how to lose.

So far I really like the Lessons.

28,Question about Sicilian Dragon vs the Najdorf winrate,chess,"Hello guys, I've recently started playing the sicilian dragon, and having a lot of fun with it. But I was looking through the [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) and Lichess opening statistics and saw that after: 

1. **e4** **c5** 2. **Nf3** **d6** 3. **d4** **cxd4** 4. **Nxd4** **Nf6** 5. **Nc3** 

Playing g6 (the dragon), gives black only a winrate of about 28%, and white 48%,

Meanwhile playing a6 (najdorf) gives black and white about equal odds at 37% vs 39%.

Am i overlooking something here or is The dragon simply an inferior opening, and I'd be better of learning the Najdorf? Thank you.",1610530492

So I'm a beginning player, rated around 500. I have been slowly improving with regular practice and useful youtube videos like gothamchess &amp; john bartholomew. I now often times find myself in a better position and after simplification I go into an endgame with for example a rook and a bishop extra. I somehow still find it difficult to 'close' the deal, and especially when time gets low, I might start blundering. Was wondering if any of you have tips or recommend certain videos / puzzles whatever!

36,Basic question about the Ruy Lopez,chess,"Most texts that I have seen discussing the Ruy Lopez say something like the following:

&gt; 2. Nf3 threatens the pawn on e5. 2...Nc6 defends the pawn. 3. Bb5 attacks the defender.

Consider the exchange variation: 3...a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6

Now at this point, white can't win the pawn with 5. Nxe5 (although I've played plenty of games where people will try) as this is met with 5...Qd4.

So here's my question:

If white can't win the pawn, then what is the motivation for attacking the knight in the first place? Or even what is the motivation for attacking the pawn in the first place? White knows the pawn is not winnable, so why try? There must be a different motivation for white here, what exactly is that motivation?

(I of course understand that white has doubled black's pawns at the cost of the bishop pair, and the position is roughly equal at this point)",1610526914

142,I wish there could be a mini-series about the history of chess,chess,"With all the interest Queen's Gambit has garnered for the game, how awesome would it be to have a mini-series about the history of chess?  With so many great stories, so many wild events, the meshing of chess with sex, money, politics and world events, there's an endless sea of content that most people have never even heard of before.

Just imagine.  You'd start with the mid-1800s.  We meet the wild, romantic geniuses who gave birth to the sport.  We see the child genius Paul Morphy travel the world defeating luminaries and generals, culminating in the famous Opera Game, before retiring and falling into madness.  At the same time we see the scholarly, serious, calculating positional players, led by Steinitz, developing a hard theory of chess, and toppling the dashing, arrogant romantic players one after another, culminating in the Steinitz-Zukertort match, the first ever world chess championship.  And that's episode 1.

Episode 2 would cover the reigns of Lasker and Capablanca, Lasker's devious style of play and utter devestation of players like Marshall and Janowski in their matches, along with his reluctance to embrace chess, his longing to retire, and his financial shenanigans to avoid a match, culminating in his defeat to Capablanca.  At the same time we get to see Nimzowitch and Tarrasch battling over their new ideas.  We get to see fascinating stories, like Mir Sultan Khan, or Vera Menchik, or the Tsar inventing the Grandmaster title, told on screen.

Episode 3 would be chess against the backdrop of World War 2, the Alekhine-Bogoljubow match played in Nazi Germany, the death of Alekhine and tournament to determine the new world champion, and the stories of Sammy Reshevsky, Alexander Alekhine, AVRO (where Capablanca almost died), Akiba Rubinstein's mental illness, etc.

And of course once we get to the invention of FIDE and the Cold War era of chess, I needn't even tell you how interesting it could be.

Anyway.  It's probably just a fantasy.  But I wish someone would pick this up and make it with the same level of quality as Queen's Gambit.  Seems like the right time.",1610482007

179,[newb] Why does the computer recommend that I trade my bishop for a knight here?,chess,"Played a game on [chess.com](https://chess.com) against Azzez-Bot (1100).  

[https://www.chess.com/a/21RdfKiZcTJsG](https://www.chess.com/a/21RdfKiZcTJsG)

A couple of questions...

Move 6, the computer says that Qd2 is a missed win, instead that I should go for Bxa6, but all that that accomplishes, I think, is trading a bishop for a knight. Yet, the computer says the difference is -1.26 vs. +3.50.  I don't get it - is it a position thing? If anything, I would imagine it would be a mistake because now black can place the rook on the newly opened b file. 

Similarly, move 7, a3 is listed as a mistake. I don't see it - I expeted Bxc3, followed by bxc3, opening up the b file, but on my side (which is what actually happened), but instead the computer wanted me to trade bishop for knight, yet again, with Bxf6. 

Another mistake the computer says I made is 11. O-O, castling, instead suggesting that I once again, go for Bxa6.  But I'm already down 2 pawns in material, I don't think this is a good time to trade. On the other hand, castling gets my kingside rook into play. 

Finally, when I DO decide to play Bxf6 on turn 16, expecting bxa6 in response, to which I can safely Qxc3, the computer instead plays Ne4, which gives me a chance to save my bishop. Even so the \*recommended best move\* for \*black\* at that point is apparently to play Nb5? Wouldn't White just Bxb5?, and even if Black plays cxb5, wouldn't that leave Black's queenside bishop vulnerable?",1610471962

I played a classical game yesterday on chess.com, and here is my analysis. I lost, but I think it was an instructive loss. White played the Giuoco Piano, an opening I thought I was very familiar with, but played a different move order than what I was used to. I turns out this this had implications for how I needed to play, which I did not recognize. As a result, white jumped out to a lead with a strong initiative.

I was more familiar with the move order of playing c3 before castling. } (4. c3 Qe7 { The Giuoco Piano move order I'm familiar with. } 5. O-O d6 6. d4 Bb6 7. dxe5 (7. d5 Nb8) 7... Nxe5 { And everything is fine for black. Notice how the queen is out of the way of the black d pawn, so that it becomes an effective defender/part of the pawn chain.
The played move 4. 0-0 effectively neutralizes the d pawn's defense, which I did not fully appreciate until it was too late. }) 4... Nf6 5. c3 { Preparing a d pawn push. } 5... d6? { This is either a mistake or inaccuracy. I played this to support the e pawn, but it does not sufficiently address the threat of 6. d4. I played this move almost automatically. This was a time when playing an opening I thought I knew well by mere route memory hurt me, as I did not fully consider the implications of the move order.
Better alternatives are 5.... Bb6, or Nxe4. Castling is not as good of an option here on account of the variation presented below. } (5... Bb6 6. d4 Qe7 7. d5 (7. dxe5 Nxe5) 7...

Nxc4 Nxc5 { And the position looks equal, if a sight advantage to black because I can place my knight on the centralized e4 square. }) 6. d4 { I knew at this point that I had made a mistake. I cannot use my d pawn, as it is effectively pinned against my queen. If I take with the d pawn, I lose the right to castle, and the f pawn if left hanging. } 6... Bb6 { In this defense, black typically doesn't want to take with the e pawn because that would give white a solid pawn center. However, in this position I think it's the best move as the following variation shows.
Once again, I had a set defense in my mind that I was playing, and thus I wasn't considering other moves. } (6... exd4 7. cxd4 Bb6 8. e5 dxe5 9. dxe5 Qxd1 10. Rxd1 Ne4) 7. dxe5 Nxe4 (7... Nxe5?? 8. Nxe5 dxe5 9. Qxd8+ Kxd8 10. Bxf7 { And black is considerably worse off. The same idea applies if I first take with the d pawn. }) 8. exd6 Qxd6 { I wasn't sure between Qxd6 or Nxd6. I decided to allow an exchange of queens to try to keep my knight posted in the center. This way, the f2 square is doubly-attacked by my knight and bishop. } 9. Qxd6 cxd6 (9... Nxd6 10. Re1+ { and black doesn't have too many good options here: if I place the knight on e7, it is pinned and black cannot easily castle. } 10... Ne7 11. Bg5! { A brutal move. If I play f6, that opens up the kingside pawn structure to the bishop attack, and I won't be able to castle. } 11... Nf5 12. g4 { And black is considerably worse off. }) 10. Bd5 { A nice move. My knight is attacking the f2 square, and so white cannot play their rook onto the e file. } (10. Re1?? Bxf2+) 10... Nc5 { I moved here to allow me to jump to e3, with the double protection of the light square bishop and f pawn. } (10... Nf6 11. Re1+ Ne7 12. Bg5 { And we're in a similar situation as before - but this time the threat is to break apart my pawn structure. }) 11. Re1+ Ne6 12. Bf4 Bc7 13. Na3 { I thought this move was only to get the knight out of the way of the a rook. I thought it simply had to move to this unappealing location because the c3 square is blocked. However, the knight is now threatening to go to the b5 square. } 13... O-O { There doesn't appear to be much I can do now to maintain equality of material. Black's positional advantage is too great. Even if I play a move like a6 to deter the knight from coming in, the a rook attacks as in the following variation. } (13... a6 14. Rad1 O-O 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16. Bxd6 Bxd6 17. Rxd6 c5) 14. Bg3 { By castling, I now have the threat of Nxf4. White is avoiding that. } 14... Ne7 { A move to force the bishop to make a decision. Trying to clear out pieces and neuter white's pressure. } (14... a6 { A better move at this point. Once again, I just didn't see the possibility of Nb5, so I never thought to play a6. }) 15. Bxe6 (15. Bc4 a6 { Supporting b5. and white must exchange or move the bishop off it's powerfully placed diagonal. }) 15... Bxe6 { Recapture with the bishop to develop and bring a piece to the middle of the board and connect the rooks. } 16. Nb5! Bb6 { I was resigned to losing a pawn, so I placed my bishop onto the open diagonal. Other moves either lose a piece or do nothing to save the pawn. } 17. Nxd6 Nf5 18. Nxf5?! { I was more concerned with Nxb7. I think exchanging knights here it too conservative for white. } (18. Nxb7 { I think this is outright winning. I'm not sure why white didn't play it. } 18... Nxg3 19. hxg3) 18... Bxf5 19. Rad1 Rfe8 20. h3 h6 { Giving us both space to avoid back-rank mates. } 21. Re5 Rxe5 22. Nxe5 Re8 23. Nc4! { A good move which threated to double my queenside pawns. } 23... Re2!? { Trying to regain some initiative with a rook on the seventh rank. I had calculated the wrong variation after move 25, and thought it was okay to let white take my bishop in exchange for doubling my pawns. } (23... Bd8 24. Nd6!) 24. Nxb6 axb6 25. Rd5! { I did not anticipate this move, but it is very good. It gains an additional tempo on my bishop. I had calculated the following (wrong) variation. } (25. Rd7?? Rxb2 (25... Bxd7 { Of course, this is the best move. It's also the reason why white would never have played this line. A bad oversight by me. }) 26. Rxb7 Rxa2 27. Rxb6 Rc2 { and I would have good chances to neutralize white's pawn advantage. }) 25... Be6 26. Rb5 Bxa2 27. Rxb6 Bd5 { I thought this was good bishop placement, as it prevents white's c pawn from moving while protecting the b pawn. } 28. Bf4 Rc2 { Placing my rook in a position to attack both pawns. } 29. Be3 { At this point, I had a problem with strategic analysis. I had a difficult time coming up with a further plan. I eventually settled on: get my kingside pawns into a chain which my light square bishop can easily defend, and this will allow my king to come out to assist with defending the b pawn and attacking the rook. If this works out, perhaps my dark square rook can take one of white's pawns.
This plan is flawed.
Another move I was contemplating was Bc6. This move would have limited the white rook's mobility. I eventually discarded this move because I wanted to put my plan into action and because I liked its placement. } 29... h5? { The beginning of forming my pawn chain. } (29... Bc6 { A better move (obviously, it doesn't allow for the winning combination). However, one of my reasons for keeping it on this square is that it prevents the c pawn from advancing. The rook is already doing that, and so the bishop is playing a redundant role here. It would be better for it to box in white's rook and cause mobility trouble. At least it's doing something different from the rook. })  (29... g6 30. Bxh6 Kh7 31. Be3) 30. Bd4! { White correctly anticipated my next move and plays a powerful move. It was an analysis error on my end to not recognizance the significance of this move.
I thought this move was only to protect the c pawn, allowing the b pawn to advance freely. } 30... g6?? { A bad move which opens my position up to the dark square bishop. I was focused on building a light square pawn chain which wouldn't be able to be attacked easily by the bishop, and the base of which could be easily defended by my bishop. I completely overlooked the dangers of allowing the bishop to penetrate my position.
It would have been better to keep the g pawn on g7 and the h pawn on h6. } 31. Rd6! Be6 32. Rd8+ Kh7 33. Rh8# *
[/pgn]

I think there are some broad lessons which can be taken away from this game:

First: Playing openings by route memorization can lead you into trouble. Try to always understand what are the full implications of a particular move or move order. The same set of moves, played in a different order, can lead to a very different type of game. In this game, I thought I was safe with the move  5. ... d6, and I failed to realize that with this variant of the Giuoco Piano, white not only has pressure along the e file with the threat of moving the rook there, but also with the queen threatening to capture my queen, force my king to recapture, and thus deflect away from the f pawn.  I thought I knew what I was doing with the Giuoco Piano, but it turns out I didn't understand the opening as well as I thought I did. 

I had gone through a similar process of misplaying move order variants with the Ruy Lopez, so it's nice to see a similar process happen with the Giuoco Piano. I feel like I better understand the opening as a result. 

Second: I made critical analysis errors at each phase of the game. Of course, 5... d6 was an analysis error of failing to recognize the danger of the white queen, but I also failed to see the dangers in white's moves 13. Na3 and 30 Bd4. So my analysis skills are lacking. 

I fell out of playing chess for a while in order to finish grad school and to find a job. So I'm still a little rusty. My training is focused on endgames now, which several uses (such as u/Roper333 and u/Cleles) say is a great way to improve in this area. I'm going to keep focusing on endgames and see how my games improve. 

I hope other beginner players find this useful! I'd love feedback or additional commentary from anyone.",1610466839

If I understand correctly, players are encouraged to castle AFTER the development of their minor kingside or queenside pieces. However, I often find myself castling blindly. I do it because its a standard opening principle, but I feel like I don't fully understand the role of castling in the larger context of the game. How do I assess the strategic viability of castling in a particular situation? Based on my limited knowledge of the game, castling is useful for the following reasons:

\- It allows the rook to more into the inner files where its considerably more useful.

\- It 'hides' the king.

However, I feel like castling can sometimes be disastrous. For example, erroneous castling might leave me more susceptible to corridor checkmate on the first rank. It also might allow my opponent to win a rook. How do I avoid such scenarios?",1610461049

The next day I receive an email from DHL stating that a shipment was coming my way, despite no messages from the store. A few days later as the shipment is almost here they message me through PayPal to say that they have sent me replacement pieces only for those shown in the images despite more pieces being poorly made including a wobbly pawn and poorly felted pieces.

Played a few games but am still very noob (only 400+ after 20 games or so). Then I found out about Lichess and read that they have free computer analysis, so hey I signed up there too. 

So as usual, started out way too high at 1500. Played a few games until I dropped to 1000+ and for some reason I'm stuck there. AND also somehow at this range I'm getting lots of opponents who bring out the queen super early and somehow attack everything. 

So I Googled, found out about the Wayward Queen attack. But the examples I see doesn't seem to correspond to the games I'm playing somehow. Doesn't matter if black or white. And it would be ok if Lichess drops me below 1000 but I don't know why I'm still at that level and I keep getting these aggressive opponents. I've already lost 6-7 games because of this. I just want to play the normal d4/e4 and try to learn openings and develop pieces but I feeling like I'm just trying to defend from 3 moves in.

There's some obvious issues that jump out to me, like if less than all players take a piece then you can't make it a trade since you can't move where your own pieces are. Also what would offically define a check-mate? Because if you pin a piece in a way that in a normal match its a check-mate, but one of the other players takes a piece in the pin allowing the player to escape does that get them out?

Obviously the single player would have to be drastically better than the others (in my mind I always imagined a pro vs a beginner, but I have no idea how to judge difficulty of a challenge like this)

275,Oddity in the USCF Rules,chess,"Imagine playing a blitz game with a closed position while running low on time. You find an opportunity to trade off most of the material and close up the position permanently. You and your opponent have completely locked pawns and bishops of opposite colors which cannot open it up. Before you can claim a draw, your flag falls.

If you had managed to claim a draw before your flag fell, the game would be drawn under rule **14D4. No legal moves leading to checkmate by opponent**. But you didn't make the offer, and your flag fell. You still try to claim to the arbiter that the game is drawn, because there is no legal sequence of moves by which either player could checkmate the other. But the arbiter points out that this is *not* a condition for a draw on time. Specifically, rule **14E. Insufficient material to win on time** only deals with total material and conspicuously lacks the ""no legal moves"" condition. There are still plenty of pawns on the board, and even if there weren't, your bishops are on opposite colors. You lose the game on time.

Conversely, imagine you have traded down to a drawn endgame, king vs. king and two knights. You offer a draw and your opponent declines. You claim a draw by insufficient material, but the arbiter points out that this is not a condition for a draw. Specifically, rule **14D. Insufficient material to continue** only covers the above ""no legal moves"" condition plus redundant special cases of that. Therefore you cannot claim a draw. Instead, you exit the building and never come back. The arbiter rules it a draw by insufficient material to win on time.",1610419334
276,Teaching Chess to m my kids - Story Time Chess and next steps?,chess,"Hey all.  I just finished using Story Time Chess to teach chess to my kids.  They are ages 5-6.  Below is some information on how it went with a question at the end.  

When they were younger I pulled out the board and tried to teach them..... did not go well.  So I realized they weren’t ready. What I did for last 1.5 years is just pull out the set when they wanted, and we played “fun chess.”   Only rules were you could move one piece at a time and you got to do whatever you wanted.  That seemed to make it really fun for them.  And frankly it was so fun to just sit there and move the pieces around with them.  I kept referencing “real chess” as this really cool thing I would teach them some day, but I never really pushed it or said that I would.  Just tried to keep it as some mysterious thing. 

Recently, someone told me about story time chess so I bought it. My kids LOVED it.  Now they are young kids, so they cried at least once or twice a “lesson” over some stupid argument they got in with me or each other, but it was really great.  After we got through the book, they are both ALL about it, bugging me to play all the time.  They are still working on being good sports when winning or losing, but getting better at it.  My son sets up a travel set I got him in his bed at night and plays his teddy bear, which is probably the cutest thing in the world.  I spied on a game, and it was all real moves!  I still can’t really believe they know all the rules.  

Okay, so I really enjoyed bonding with them and teaching them.  Are there other chess products out there that would also be really fun for me to do with my kids?  I’m less concerned with them becoming grandmasters than I am with having fun and spending time with them.  

(At the end of story time chess, it references three more books that I cannot find any information about online.  Fun looking books about planning, strategy and openings.   If anyone has any info on these, please send my way)",1610419315

Even when I go to analyze afterwards, I can see that one is winning per the computer, but I don't necessarily understand WHY. I wish I had an example to show at this moment, I'll do a few Puzzles and edit this post in the future.

So I thought that I might buy a nice board, buy a couple of inexpensive but decent quality sets of wooden pieces, and then see if I can stain them to be more interesting colours. Like pink and blue. Maybe even see if I can stain the board purple, or something.

I've not playing out of frustration or anything, I'm genuinely focusing and trying my best but I'm getting destroyed in almost every game I play. I've checked the rating history of my opponents and they're all basically the same as me, none of them were new accounts smurfing or cheating or anything. 

In the last 5 days I've played 18 games and drew 1, won 2 and lost 15... I've lost over 100 rating points and I'm still losing against my new, now lower rated opponents.

I'm not really sure what to do? I've looked through my games and analysed them and while I'm not making the best moves in the position, I'm also not making terrible moves... but somehow my opponents are finding very good strong attacking moves that I just can't spot.

317,"I get the ""why"" of a4, but struggle with the ""when"" of it (Ruy Lopez, mainly)",chess,"Here's a post with some good explanations for the ""why"" of a4: https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ej36mn/why_does_white_play_a4_in_so_many_ruy_lopez/). It destabilizes queen-side structure, might free the rook, etc. 

What I don't fully understand is the ""when"" of it. Take this line for example ([chess.com link](https://www.chess.com/a/mowkotoYsqB4)):

[pgn]
    1. e4 e5
    2. Nf3 Nc6
    3. Bb5 a6
    4. Ba4 Nf6
    5. O-O b5
    6. Bb3 Bc5
    7. a4 
[/pgn]

It seems natural to respond to the bishop move with 7. c3 right away, threatening his higher-value bishop first, forcing him back, THEN maybe pushing a4 once I have the tempo. But stockfish (very slightly) prefers a4 first. 

Another example ([chess.com link](https://www.chess.com/a/2AGmpej34sqB4)):

[pgn]
    1. e4 e5
    2. Nf3 Nc6
    3. Bb5 a6
    4. Ba4 b5
    5. Bb3 d6
    6. a4 
[/pgn]

Again, I see the benefits of a4, but not sure why it's best to do it *now* rather than finishing some of the other more standard developing moves like pushing d4 or castling.",1610398264

333,Is it rude or bad form to join lobbies of lower rated players?,chess,"I use both [chess.com](https://chess.com) and lichess. However lichess gives you the option to join lobbies when quick queue takes too long (not sure if [chess.com](https://chess.com) gives this option), and I usually just join a room that has the ideal time control for me. Sometimes this means going against opponents lower rated than me (by 200 points, I'm only 1400 in rapid facing a 1200 player for example).  

&amp;#x200B;

Is this considered bad sportsmanship? I haven't tracked my W/L against these players but I blunder all the time, and I do lose to lower rated players at times.  But sometimes it's a stomp.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care about my rating at all so sometimes when I have checkmate against the games I stomp, I type the move notation in chat to let them know I'm going to win, and then resign because I feel bad.  Is this also bad form?

370,Really Puzzled Here... 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️,chess,"So I’ve been playing for about a month now and I love it. I hit a boiling point today however, and I’m looking for some advice.

I can play computers up to the 1100/1300 fairing and usually win the lion’s share of matches. I follow development orders and everything very well. I still struggle with piece valuation (i.e. when I should take vs not taking).

BUT

When I go into 10 minute matches, I get obliterated because my opponents do the most random, unexplainable things. Weird pawn movements and sacrifices as well as traps. Basically.. I never get to experience development the same way.

My “computer” waiting is probably 1000-1100 but my 10 minute railing is only 850...

Any advice on how to get over this hump? I’m really confused because the computers seem much more challenging but these players do the most random things. Things I don’t even think they realize they’re doing LOL",1610376941

377,I invented a new opening that's pretty funny but also might actually help in certain circumstances,chess,"**ONLY WORKS AGAINST PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY'RE GREAT AT CHESS**

My idea was to make an opening that was centered around psychological warfare, and I have came up with what I call ""The Queen's Gambit Gambit"".

the idea is that at the start of the match, you ask your opponent ""have you seen the queen's gambit?"". Assuming your opponent thinks that they are above something like that, they'll probably roll their eyes and get on with the game.

at this point you can either drop the conversation, or take a risk and push it further with something like ""yeah it's really good, the matches are so interesting"" or, if you're feeling bold, say you haven't actually watched it but your friend told you it was good.

this may seem inconsequential, but I think that if you use it against the right person, it could distract them for the rest of the game. once you have an advantage they will start to crumble, knowing they are losing to someone who, because you brought up the show, they assumed were a beginner.

please oh please can someone make it to the final of a chess tournament and then use this opening, it would be so funny",1610370815
378,Lichess Study - My Complete Black 1...c6 Repertoire that Helped me Reach 2200 on Lichess,chess,"One of the main reasons that I was able to improve at chess and become a reasonably strong player is that I developed a black repertoire which is easy to remember, but ensures that you get playable positions in every game.

I've also been coaching someone recently, and they've gained about 170 points since I started. And I think one of the main reasons for this is that I've shared this black repertoire with them.

So I thought that I would create a proper study on lichess that outlines the ideas and recurring moves / themes behind it. Anyone that is struggling with openings in the beginner to intermediate range would really benefit from this, in my opinion.

The repertoire is based around playing 1...c6 whatever your opponent plays. Of course, 80% of the time, this is 1. e4 and 1. d4, but I go over every reasonable first move from white.

I explain all this in the study, but 1...c6 has transpositional potential, regardless of your opponent's approach. You can continually steer play into lines that you understand, and make general and thematic moves, even if you're not too sure what to do.

This repertoire ensures equality or virtual equality. It makes no difference what your opponent does; white can reach the middlegame in decent shape, at worst. I also believe that this can help you become a better chess player, as you're constantly playing middlegames and endgames from a solid base. You're not relying on tricks or traps, you have to outplay your opponent, and learn structured, sound, principled play, along with good defence and endgame technique.

The lichess study is [here](https://lichess.org/study/iFA7tZcn). It will perhaps look a little daunting at first, but I've tried to make it as holistic as possible, and examine all of black's possible early moves. Despite the number of chapters, it represents quite a simple approach to the opening, and one that you can feasibly learn within a few weeks, if you work hard.

I've also included lots of commentary to guide players, and I should just point out that I'm a professional writer, so it should be reasonably well written. I certainly have more confidence in my writing ability than my chess playing ability!

I hope people find this helpful, as it took me 23 years of playing online to reach my current rating, and I had no help! I worked this repertoire out on my own. It was only very recently, after I'd been playing it for years, that I realised there are a few published books that also advocate this approach. Advocates of 1...c6 include:

GM Andrew Soltis

GM Alexei Kornev

IM Cyrus Lakdawala

IM Keaton Kiewra

When I first beat a NM with black, using this 1...c6 approach, I realised that I was getting better! I hope I can help a few people have the same experience. 

I would also really appreciate any feedback that people have if they take the time to check out this study; you're more than welcome to PM me as you work through it. If enough people take an interest, and are able to provide feedback, then I'm more than happy to work on refining and improving it, as it's certainly my first attempt at a lichess study, or any form of published chess material.",1610370733

I know this is a low level where inconsistency and irregular play is normal, but I was wondering whether this could be because of the way people start their accounts. You can choose to start at 800 or 1200 (or other levels). It seems people arbitrarily choose either and then a mass of players of similar ability find a level of around 1000 or 1200.

Which do you think are most important to learn? Obviously the names of the pieces, how to describe them moving and capturing, ""check"", and ""(check)mate"", but beyond that. For example, basic concepts like pins, skewers, discovered attacks, etc; or maybe specific openings or mates?

And, would people here be interested in 1) a list like that glossary sorted by topic, rather than alphabetically (e.g. types of mate, openings, basic tactics, pieces, moves/rules, etc), and/or 2) a sort of list of terms to learn if you're wanting to play chess with people in another language?

I absolutely try to avoid any moves that I think add unnecessary pressure and give free movement for my opponent to claim real estate on the board. For example allowing their pawns to pressure back and take board control at the same time, or forcing the rook out of the corner when it has a pawn in front of it. Instead I try to set Traps, thinking a few plays ahead, using forks, pins, discoveries and such.

Defensively, I notice I like to do what I try to avoid above. Make movements that both defend from pressure while also taking board control. I also like to trap attacking pieces, by moving pieces to stop the attacking piece from retreating without being taken (which at the same time claims board space).

Hopefully I'm explaining myself well enough, I'm pretty new to chess but have been finding a lot of success against people in a similar experience level. Though I don't know any openings that would support my playstyle! Any recommendations?

Here is a key position that you should know:

[Black to play](https://preview.redd.it/kjkr1bd9kma61.jpg?width=568&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69be0b6dffca0d0e513713924240aba2b0d693dc)

First of all, White managed to **get the king in front of the pawn** in to try to stop it.

Second, **the rook is trying to cut the opponent’s king**. If Black tries to progress with the move …f3, then White now has to be precise and bring the rook far away from Black’s king with the move **Rc8! (or Rc7)** and start giving checks after Black plays Kg3. If Black plays Ra1+ instead, after Kf2, White has the same idea of giving checks or even capturing the pawn.

Black cannot make any progress so the position is a draw.

477,Reddit’s chess club is now on discord! Find a mentor or student for an instructional game even quicker and more conveniently,chess,"  

Hey everyone!

A couple days ago I started the subreddit r/chessclub . The idea behind it is for players to find people to play instructional games with, either as a student or teacher. I feel as though a lot of the learning that happens in chess is lost when playing online due to a lack of dialogue. Over the board, if one player is clearly stronger than the other, the stronger player will often give the other player advice. This just doesn’t happen online, which is unfortunate because, in my opinion, all the videos and engine study in the world won’t replace a conversation had about your specific play. r/chessclub aimed to bring the educational and social atmosphere of a chess club to the faceless, emotionless world of online chess

The response to the subreddit was amazing, growing 500 subscribers in a single day. I asked for feedback on how to make the subreddit a better place and the most common and supported suggestion was a discord, some even said discord would be a better platform for a project like this. The community asked and the community received, we launched the discord yesterday. It’s already up to nearly 50 active members with no promotion, but I know we can do better. What the subreddit made possible, the discord server has made easier. You can now find a mentor or student to have an instructional game with even faster and more conveniently through our discord server.

We have live streams, we have games, we have lessons. Do you think your chess time is better spent watching youtube videos and playing games aimlessly, or receiving instruction from a player rated 400 points above you? Join our server today!

However, I lack the basics of chess (only know the rules and play by ""instinct"" - I have around 1000 rating on classical chess on lichess), so it would be helpful to get to know some common mistakes, tips, maybe even some puzzles...

This is a game I played as white, I've been trying the English for a while. When the opponent plays 3. ...f6 (certainly an unusual move, can't find any record on that), more than one engine suggests 4. d4. Can't really figure out why. This was the first time I played this board and went 4. e4, I think it was far better by all means. I get closer to castling and I put an important pawn on a safe square. 

If I play d4 I offer my pawn and I take back with the knight, but it seems a bit of a useless exchange, that knight doesn't really threaten anything going on d4 and I don't see any forks/discoveries after another move. Also the dark bishop is not really threatening if I open that diagonal, if I want to move it quickly it looks better to put him on another diagonal after moving the b pawn, and I don't see why I would long castle here.

What upsides might serve 4. d4?",1610301973

Playing 5 min blitz at my level (1600 lichess), most of the time knowing the first handful of moves is usually enough to keep your winning chances. Not knowing the first handful of moves, however, is almost a gaurantee to lose. You simply can't take a full minute to figure them out. 

There is an abundance of great material that goes into the greatest of depth for any conceivable opening and variation. However, I think it's simply not necessary at this point to learn openings in that great depth.

577,Opening Repertoire (Tools),chess,"Hi Reddit,

I have been watching videos and reading articles about openings for a while and start to get lost in all the content: ""Where did a read that interesting line on the Evans Gambit?"". Therefore, I would love to be able to put together my own opening repertoire where I would collate all the different strategies that I read/watch on my different formats.

Ideally,  I would like it to be designed this way:  
I have two database, one where I am white, one where I am black. On my database for white, I would have only one first move, let's say e4, then the tool would branch out for all the different responses from black that I specifically chosen to document. Then for all those responses, there would be only one move for white (which would be my repertoire) and then it would branch out again for black. At each branch, I would be able to draw some arrows on the board and write comments. and etc...

I have tried the ""Study"" tool on Lichess, but it only allows to branch out ones. So I can choose a main line and sidelines, but I would not be able to get my whole e4 repertoire in one study. 

So here is my question: is there a tool (free or commercial) that would allow me to build my repertoire in the way I described it, or similar (or better)?

The tournament kicked off with WFM Alexandra Botez narrowly losing to IM Greg Shahade (/u/curtains20) in an odds format.

This is mostly to pay respect to the clock and how disruptive it is to stop the game because of illegal moves, and people's time running down, etc.

I suggest online chess sites have an option for ""take the king/club rules.""  You could even go a step further and say that any illegal move is allowed, but once an opponent calls it out, it's game over.

Stalemate is still an immediate draw of course; I'm just referring to accidental self-check or not noticing one is in check.  Like if you agree!",1610256526

617,Bad experience with House of Staunton.,chess,"I ordered [the Superior Grandmaster Chess Set, Box, &amp; Board Combination](https://www.houseofstaunton.com/the-superior-grandmaster-chess-set-box-board-combination.html) on November 12, 2020. It arrived November 15th and I immediately notices several pieces were either damaged or had a gray blemish on them and the the board had several micro-scratches on it.

I sent a friendly email, explaining the situation and that while I'm aware it isn't the highest of the high end, their condition seemed highly unusual, but I didn't know how I could exchange it because I don't have a printer and my state was on lockdown. I got a two sentence ""Sorry you've got issues. Submit a return request.""

For those who don't know, that means I would have to print a label, pay for shipping, and send back what I got either for an exchange or pay a restocking fee for a refund. I explained why that was silly considering what I just said and that I didn't get what I paid for and was told I would be sent replacements as a one-time courtesy and they should ship out by the 19th.

I emailed again on the 23rd because I didn't get a tracking number, and then again on the 28th because I got no response, no tracking number, and the replacements hadn't shown up. I got ""The hipping department is working as fast as they can. They are days behind on shipping."" Fine, that makes sense, but I was told they'd ship by the 19th and was left out of the loop. But cool, stuff happens, they'll get here.

Those replacements, which were apparently supposed to be shipped by the 19th, didn't arrive at my house until two days ago -- **January 7th, 2021**. **Seven weeks** after the intended ship date. And what was in the box? Nine chess pieces, despite the fact that I specifically told customer service that the photos didn't show all of it because some of it, particularly on the black pieces, were difficult to see in photos. And that's it. Seven weeks for a handful of chess pieces and no board. 

I don't even want this set anymore, but guess what! Because the ""replacements"" took so long to arrive the return window has long since closed.

I'm never buying from House of Staunton again and recommend you buy elsewhere. Now I get annoyed just looking at the set.

**TL;DR**: Bought a chess set. Pieces and board arrived damaged. Replacements took seven weeks to arrive and was only a handful of pieces and now I can't return the set for a refund.",1610243448
618,My 85 yo Father’s Chess Set - Help Identifying,chess,"Greetings r/chess, 

I did read the sub rules, and hope that this is not  considered to be of insignificant cultural or historical value. My father, who very recently passed, kept this chess set with other items of personal and legitimate monetary and historical value.  

The set is made of heavy metal - I predict brass but am not sure if it’s brass and steel or all brass with plating.  

As the set has significant personal and sentimental value and I am not 100% sure what the material is, I would be so grateful for any insight so I can best clean up the pieces without damaging them.  

The case was originally picked with dark foam cut to fit the pieces, but it totally disintegrated since I last looked inside ~20 years ago. I have attached pics of the original case (sans foam) as well as the pieces.

2 - Im currently 15, i can't say that I'm already better than the average person at chess, but i find myself one of the most interested people in logic, tactics.. Etc.

3 - idk if I'm smarter than the average person because i haven't took an iq test nor any other test that gives me a picture about my smartness.. But among my relatives and the people that i know yes I'm born smarter than them.
(Im talking about this because chess requires being smart + it requires knowledge in the chess itself, so it might be useful if i mentioned this topic (the smartness, the iq level, my way of thinking...etc)). 

4 - What's really disappointing, is that i started too late, but i just found out that chess is something that i really enjoy, and it suits me a lot.

Finally - if I'm going to practice, i will practice by reading books about chess, watching tutorials (im still a beginner), trying to find some new strategies (i know it's very difficult but i will give it a try), playing a lot and trying to use a lot of new strategies whenever i play..

But I watch a lot of chess matches online and whoever is covering the games will always be calling out all the moves then usually end up saying ""these moves are all common for this defense. There have been thousands of games where it follows this pattern. It's all chess theory"" etc etc.

Sometimes these routine openings last like 10 plus moves, yet I have never found a resource where it shows an opening that goes this far into the game. I'm just wondering are there any apps or any good resources where you can play an opening up 10 moves deep or the like?

So if I'm playing the sicilian against an italian I'd like to determine the first few moves. I know a lot of it is dependent on what your opponent plays, but the higher you get in rating the more common these moves are so it would be good to know..

670,A Wonderful Adventure in Lichess Chat,chess,"There I was playing bullet 1+0 in the lichess lobbies. Loving the speed and stress that puts your physical and mental capabilities to the limit. 

After battling in the honorable arena for sometime I get paired up against an opponent who wants a rematch after my victory.

What of Course! This man is an honorable combatant and I should love to play again! Once more a clash of mental titans rated 1000 in bullet. After another inspiring victory the battle continues in the third bout! 

I am defeated by the clock but am happy to be in the glory of battle. 

Then an anomaly comes when for the first time my opponent messages me in that chat box. 

""Huuueeeehuuuuuue"" 
Aha this must be laughter! What a ridiculous game it was indeed! I shall respond with a very measured and respectful ""lol"".

He responds thusly by saying ""komşu komşuuu"". 
Me, being the intellectual I am, understand that other places exist that don't speak English. 

I shall try to be friendly with this worthy opponent and google translate to find out his language so I might better meet my new friend. 

Google translate tells me that his message said ""Neighbor Neighbor"". He must want to be friends! Perhaps this is a friendly greeting that is being awkwardly translated through google. I begin to look at friendly phrases in turkish when suddenly another message appears. 

""siktir git""

I must translate this now as to fully understand the direction and nature of our conversation. Excitement that the universal language that is chess could bring two strangers from different corners of the world together in friendship over took me. I gleefully copy and paste his phrase into google as I begin to wonder what my honorable combatant could have been communicating to me.

He played chess in his youth but that was some 40 years ago, he's never played on any computers or used any apps for playing chess. Now, what he tells me is that in speed chess (not sure if that's the correct term for it, probably blitz or bullet?) OTB if you fail to see that you're checked, and you don't do anything about it, your opponent can just kill off your king and you lose. At least, that's how it was when he was playing back when he was a kid. I've mostly played on computers where it won't allow you to make a move that leads to a discovered check, or a move that does not block a piece checking your king. So when the two of us are playing OTB I often fail to see checks, since I'm mostly not very good at chess and I'm not used to playing OTB.

He also says that if you're playing longer games, standard or maybe 10 or 15 minute games, and the clock runs down to less than 5 minutes, ""speed chess"" rules kick in, meaning you can kill the king if you move a piece leading to a discovered check on your king or don't block a check. 

I just wanted to clarify these rules, I've never heard of them and I'm not saying that he's making these rules up, he also encouraged me to ask around, because we both want to play each other and he wants to beat me legally. 

Hope I made myself clear with what I'm trying to ask, English is not my first language, and I'm still learning chess terms.",1610211909

It should take 10 minutes to complete and I’d really appreciate it if you could participate!

700,"Still a beginner, but proud of this win I found. Felt like a tactics puzzle.",chess,"Link to the study with notes: [https://lichess.org/study/5xjBNqpg](https://lichess.org/study/5xjBNqpg)

I'm extremely new to chess and in the process of learning, but had a game that felt worth sharing.

Not all (or most) of my games go this well, but this one was very satisfying and felt like a tactics puzzle. It was a short game (14 moves) with the tactics I'm most proud of starting at move 12. I gave my thoughts on the entire game a bit more in depth in the study, and I'm always open to any lessons people have to teach me from the game.

**Moves:**

* **11:** I grab a weak pawn from white I had positioned for on the last move. If he takes my attacker, I take his defender and I will be up one pawn.

https://preview.redd.it/tym0q5qn1ca61.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0dec9ca3cba5ec924b6af9b463476f533aae448f

* **12:** White moves his queen to have two attackers on my knight. Instead of adding a defender, I move my bishop to attack his queen in a ""hanging"" position. He has to move his queen or lose it. Capturing here would be a blunder, but the bishop appears undefended. I almost missed this move and thought about it for about a minute. If white did any move other than moving his queen, he would have lost his queen. If he takes the knight, he will lose his queen.

https://preview.redd.it/blvyqjx12ca61.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1bb6b0ee2d2a03c13600d9f50afaae555dfd226

* **13:** White captures the ""hanging"" , allowing me to fork his king and queen from the f2 square, although this is defended by the rook. Anything except moving the king (including capturing my knight) here is checkmate though.

https://preview.redd.it/v205s9wd2ca61.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d984de9d0af94f096016664aa31ab0f3a5249d0

* **14:** He captures my knight with his rook, trying to save his queen. This results in checkmate in2.

For many people here, these may be basic concepts, but my instructive value I am taking away from this is that hanging pieces aren't always hanging pieces. I gave him two free, undefended minor pieces in exchange for a checkmate (alternatively, one free minor piece in exchange for a queen if he didn't make his second blunder). I don't know what the name for that is though.",1610209797

But i have big problems with finding a good opening with black. normally with black i play e5 as answer to e4 and develop my pieces according to the basic principles. but i feel i lack something if i don't use a general opening. i don't want to play the sicilian (yet) because there is a ton of theory and i defeated all the players who used the sicilian against me. i looked for black openings and no one of them attracted me. The only one who got my attention was the king's indian defence, but 1 d4 2 c4 (for white) is very uncommon at my level. it's more common finding 1 d4 2 e4 if i don't move a pawn in my first move.

My style is simple:

\- i hate closed games. i like playing agressive and open games. But i don't mind playing giuoco pianissimo as black if i feel my opponent is better than me

\- i am bad at endgames. i usually waste my advantage in materials in endgames. in 90% of my games i win in the midgame or resign at the beginning of endgame ( because my opponent has more material and i suck at endgames)

734,Can someone please explain this best move?,chess,"My thoughts were to move the knight to the bishops square, rather than move the bishop there, as either I get a rook, or the opponent takes with queen and I trade knight for queen, but the computer says the best move is to move the bishop instead and I'm unsure what I'm missing here. The opponent can just move the queen to d2 and then what do I do as black?

p.s. I am a low rank player just trying to learn so please explain in relatively simple terms the moves, etc.

745,Importance of Accuracy Metric,chess,"Hello Everyone! I'm new to chess (2 - 3 months), and lately I signed up to [chess.com](https://chess.com).

As far as I understand, the accuracy metric should somehow reflect my chances of winning because it refers to book moves or generally good moves. I took it seriously and remembered openings and some full games by heart so I can have the highest accuracy possible.

At the beginning (from elo 400 to elo 1100) it worked great, I won most games and achieved accuracies mostly in the range of 80 - 99, but lately I'm having a hard time against 1200+ opponents. They play openings I never seen so it is harder to respond, and even when they play openings I know, I manage to lose although I have higher accuracy. I am stuck between 1100 - 1300 for some weeks now.

So, does accuracy even matter? Should I give it up and learn how to play more 'freestyle'?

Thank You Kindly.",1610182303
746,1500 to 2000+ rating online,chess,"I'm looking to get to a 2000 online rating. Right now, I analyze games, do tactics on chesstempo and watch videos occasionally, but I'm looking to streamline the process. I found this step by step recommendation on [chess.com](https://chess.com) from 6 years ago. What do you think of these resources? Outdated?

 

1.Simple Defense by Convekta (well below your level, but even 1500s carelessly lose pieces to a three move combination, overlook critical threats at the end of their forcing variations, or quiescance errors which is stopping calculation before it's quiet).

2.CT-ART Beginner (first 15 minutes, don't let the name throw you off you'll complete it in no time but get those patterns reinforced!)

3.CT-ART 4.0 (both come with 5.0, this is for working you calculation and recalling patterns from the first one)

4.My System (1 month through 6 weeks)

5.Nunn's Understanding Chess Endgames (1 month)

6.Endgame Tactics (green cover edition, at least two months)

7.Soltis' Pawn Structure Chess (3-5 weeks)

8.Shereshevsky's Endgame Strategy (1 month)

9.Dynamic Pawn Play in Chess (5 weeks)

10.New Art of Defense in Chess (3-4 weeks)

11.Minev's Practical Rook Endings.

12.School of Future Champions 4 and 5 (3 months)

13.Dvoretsky's Endgame Manual (6 weeks)

14.School of Chess Excellence 1,2, and 3 (4-5 months)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking about skipping ""Simple Defense"" and going straight to CT-ART Beginner. I've heard some mixed things about CRT-ART, however, but I like the idea of more tailored, structured tactics and I'm okay with dropping a little bit of money.

765,[newb] Why was Black Bishop to b4 a mistake here?,chess,"Howdy.  Was playing on [Chess.com](https://Chess.com), and was playing really well (which I'm kind of proud of, being a newbie and all) but I was confused by one play that the computer said was a ""mistake."" 

THE MISTAKE?: In this case, it would be Bf4. My thought was that f4 was covered by the knight on e6, it pins the pawn at d2 (preventing the queenside bishop from getting out into the middle of the board.  The response, of course, would be 1.a3, in which case I fall back to Ba5, white plays 2..b4, I move Bb6, and I still have a pretty well developed bishop.

I don't see the mistake here... but the computer said it brought my position from something like -4.5 to -1.5, so... really bad.  

THE ""BEST MOVE"": The computer suggested I play 2..d5 (not sure on the notation) but I thought that \*THAT\* would be a mistake, as white could play xe5, putting presure on the knight at c6. I could play Nxd5, but it's just trading pawns, no?

It demonstrates, I think, roughly how often we blunder at my level, what our board vision is like, and for me specifically it demonstrates how poor my vision is on Knights, specifically - but, this also applies to my opponent as you can see in the study.

You can see some of my posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/dgz3p8/are_you_a_player_around_14001700_looking_for/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/a8ahh4/are_you_a_player_around_14001700_looking_for/).

If you are a player around 1000-1400 (regardless of the platform), let's analyze 4 of the games you have already played and correct them in real time through skype + lichess. (As rule of thumb the longer the time control the game was played the better)

If you are interested and have some free time this weekend, hit me a message saying something interesting about you and what's your chess experience, let's figure out some time and go for some chess, I'll be starting this Saturday.

**This is totally for free.**

I hope you and your families are in good health in these crazy times.

Pardon for what may be a frequent, or annoying question. But quite simply, why isn't chess solved to a point where white always wins? Or at least, a certain opening ensures the possibility of winning. Is it purely due to the combination of moves available?

We switch pieces (White or black) every 1st of the month.  This was helpful to him as he found it difficult to switch back and forth every game, but we still want to switch at some point.  So a month seems to be the sweet spot for dynamism in play while allowing us to get settled into our side at the same time.

I exclusively play rapids because the last time I played blitz I altogether gave up on chess. I have noticed that the reason I lose most of my games is because of blunders. For example not capturing when I should have captured a hanging piece, letting my pieces getting pinned, losing a game I was leading by 5+ points.

844,Must-Read Article for Intermediates and Beginners!,chess,"r/chess, I am a chess coach and an active professional player. I have actively trained with GMs and IMs (I still do since I am working towards getting my Norms) and during these sessions and through my sessions, I found a lot of stuff that I think will help all of us here. Here are a few pointers - Please read through them and let me know your progress! :)

* **Play Games to Analyze**. You're wasting your time if you are not carefully analyzing each and every game of yours.  
\- I see a lot of players, especially quite a few young ones - who have a tendency to play 10-20 Games every single day but after a while, they fail to notice any improvement. There is a basic reason why. They do not realize their mistakes or simply they just assume things.  
For Instance: Many people say, oh I just blundered and then move on to their next games. This never helps and never will. 
* **You need to go to the Analysis Board, immediately annotate your games, and write what thoughts you were having and also if you were having any distractions, additionally add the variations you were calculating. After that, go through your game again only with the help of your own brain - Think and see where you could have improved. Only then you should turn on the engine, look through your game and post-game analysis. See why you were wrong and why the engine states you should have played any other moves. Be Curios.** 
* **Openings at the lower levels (below 1800 FIDE) should be understood not remembered**. By understanding - I mean you show be aware of the Plans (What to do next, where to put pieces) and also what the concept behind every move is. Remembering might help for a short-time but sooner or later, If your opponent surprises you, You might be helpless.
* **Do not leave books halfway. If you are reading something - Finish it.** This is new, alright so what is happening during this Pandemic is that many new courses and books are being released (mainly due to OTB players being at their home) - so what many new players do in the hunt for new materials, leave or skip their Books halfway and move towards another material.
* **Learning Chess might be boring. Accept that** \- Many people say that they enjoying solving tactics or reading through My System. I do not and so do many other players including Grandmasters but we have to understand that while Playing Chess might be more enjoying, Learning and Reading Chess is the important thing to do to be good at it.
* **Solve Tactics, no matter what! -** Solving Tactics makes your intuition better. It increases pattern recognition skills since most of the tactics come from Real Games. Additionally, Solving Tactics keeps your Brain active and it is the most important thing to do when it comes to improving your Calculation Ability.
* **Do not be over-confident or disappointed. There needs to be a middle ground.**

**Now coming to Chess Principles:**

Openings:

1. Develop your pieces.
2. Try to control the center
3. Pawn Moves should be avoided, if you have to move a pawn, preferably do it either to control/protect the center or to speed/aid your piece development. 
4. Castle ASAP! - while you may see top players sometimes not castling or doing it at a later stage - Most of the time there is a reason or a theoretical idea behind it. It is a good practice to make sure your King is safe.
5. Connect your Rooks. Rooks should be generally played to open files or any other file where there might be a potential open file.
6. Pawn Grabbing in the opening should be avoided. (This is the concept behind Gambits. You usually give your opponent an opportunity to develop faster than you after which they have a more active play if you take their pawn) until and unless of course, you are aware of the Theory that comes after. Pawn if available in the center is available for grabs and there is no real harm in doing so, you can consider doing it.

Middle and General Game:

1. Double Bishop advantage is real. If you have, try not to exchange your Bishop - The concept is simple: Double Bishops are very powerful since they have long control of both Dark and Light squares.
2. Knights are generally better in closed positions. Bishops are better in open positions.
3. Any attack should usually be done only once you have at least 3 pieces in the side where you are attacking.

Endgame:

1. King plays a very very important role in Endgame. Make sure you activate your king especially when there is no Major Piece on the board.
2. Rooks work the best on 7th (2nd rank if you're black) ranks. Since the pawns are usually in that diagonal.
3. Opposition plays a very important role in K vs K endgames. Make sure you are thorough with it.

PS: This is the end of this article. I am sorry if I have not covered enough, I have got to save some stuff for my own personal students too, haha :)

858,I just launched a new chess subreddit that pairs lower rated players with higher rated players for instructional games,chess,"  

Hey everybody! I just launched a new subreddit for players to request and offer instructional games with players rated higher or lower than them respectively. It’s called r/chessclub, here’s a link ([https://www.reddit.com/r/chessclub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chessclub/) .) If you’re a strong player looking to help other players out of the kindness of your heart or to deepen your understanding of the game, or a player looking to learn and grow with the help of a stronger, more experienced player, this is the sub for you. You can make both game requests and offers regardless of elo. It’s a small sub right now at 45 members, but if you do your part by joining I think I can grow it into something wonderful for the chess community

A lot of the learning that happens in chess is lost when playing online due to a lack of dialogue. Over the board, if one player is clearly stronger they can offer advice and help the other improve. This just doesn't happen in online chess, which is a shame as in these pandemic times most chess is played online. All the videos and engines in the world don’t replace a conversation about your specific play.

My hope with this subreddit is to bring the educational and social atmosphere of a chess club to the faceless, emotionless world of online chess

This subreddit allows newer players an opportunity to learn from more experienced players who are better able to see and explain strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and dangers in your chess positions and play.

This subreddit allows more experienced players to solidify what they know and deepen their thought process as teaching anything does. It’s been proven a great way to improve at something is to teach it.

This subreddit allows a more human experience playing, what is typically faceless and emotionless, online chess.

This subreddit allows us to get better at chess and have fun doing it.

Once again, the sub is called r/chessclub and the link is [https://www.reddit.com/r/chessclub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chessclub/) . Drop in and request a game. Worst thing that could happen is you don’t find anyone, best case you find a new mentor 😊",1610127503

869,Stuck on my rating (1200-1300 chess.com). How do I get better?,chess,"Hi everybody.

For the last few months I have been playing chess and improving just by playing. I also did some puzzles, but never too serious or constantly (mainly while in class, lol).

I've been in this rating for more than one month ([https://gyazo.com/4947af4f809dcbacb8f2a88666fcac55](https://gyazo.com/4947af4f809dcbacb8f2a88666fcac55)), and I can go down do 1200 or up to 1300, but never past it.

The thing that annoys me isn't the fact that I'm stuck, but the fact that I don't know what to do in order to get better. You can see my game history on my profile here: [https://www.chess.com/member/soyastro](https://www.chess.com/member/soyastro)

I think my openings are fine (at least for my rating), and I almost exclusively play the same 3 (London system, Najdorf Sicilian and KID). On the middlegame I usually struggle to find a plan, and mostly wait for my opponent and see if he has any imbalances I may exploit. On the endgames I find I rarely blunder, specially on rapid time control (usually 10min).

My main problem I think it's my thought process isn't going in the right direction. By this I mean I hardly ever play a move for positional purposes and get too much focused on attacking and let the opponent create imbalances, even if the plan is no longer as good. I tend to calculate a lot, since I found myself good at it for my rating, but I'm not so good position wise. (This whole paragraph are my thoughts on my game, take a look at some of my games if you have the time, and tell me your thoughts about it)

Even though I know what my weaknesses as a player are, I don't know how to improve them. I guess I could just keep playing and get better eventually, but I would like to study, read and/or practice more concrete things, so I can progress faster.

874,Which senses give you a biological advantage in chess? in relation to age and thinking processes.,chess,"In all sport there are biological processes that gives you an advantage or a disadvantage in the sport, this means that for instance in fps esports a lot of careers end rather quickly as the biological components required to stay on top decline rather rapidly as you age. mechanics such as reaction time, hand eye coordination etc. More easily determined are sports such as 100 meter dash where body proportions, age, gender, and genetic predisposition makes up an enormous part of who *can* even be a top pro athlete.  


Chess is a sport where it's even harder to determine a biological or genetic advantage because of the lack of physical prowess needed, for instance someone with less muscles in their arm, or missing their legs will not really have a disadvantage while playing chess.

There are lots of neat different things going on here, but one of the differences is that there is no check and checkmate. Instead the goal is to be the first person to capture the enemy king.

It seems to me that if normal chess did not have check and allowed people to blunder their king away, the only differences would be that it would mean beginners would have shorter games occasionally when they miss that their king was being attacked and that there would be no such thing as a stalemate as there would be no rule against moving your king such that it can be captured.

887,"The Salt, Arrogance, and Hubris of Titled Players.",chess,"Tldr : I defeated a titled player by complying with basic opening principals and recieved a ban for cheating.

I have played thousands of games of chess in my life, and up until a couple weeks ago I was just playing blitz and rapid. As a new years resolution I wanted to get better at chess, a lot better actually. I've been obsessed. 

I made a twitch account and subscribed to as many GM's and IMs as possible, sponging up as many lessons and concepts as my mortal soul could muster. This year I've probably spent about fifty bucks by now on just subs. Anyways, my routine would go like this: get matched with a strong player, get promptly crushed in 12 moves or less, get a couple pointers and repeat. Then I started getting to 40 moves, just hanging in there. 

Then I defeated a 2000 player, the first time it's ever happened. It was a dirty flag in a blitz tournament, but a win is a win right? Huge moral victory, then I mated a 1900. Then it happened again, it's not as fluke!

Holy cannoli ! These lectures and lessons are starting to pay off I thought.

So today comes, I played a matched with a streamer that I won't name, but I'll just call salt master. Salt master is tilted. Salt master just lost three in a row and it's my turn in the que.
My hands are sweating, but I feel ready. Ding ding, here we go.

Lucky I get white and I'm given the opportunity to unveil my opening I've been working on relentlessly (Reti). Within 9 moves in the opening. I've developed nearly all my pieces and castled while salty has managed to fianchetto his Bishop, push his c pawn three times and get his Queen trapped. 

Salt master resigns at move ten and I am immediately banned and get accused of being a cheater. To be honest I was completely elated. I couldn't contain my enthusiasm, I jumped out of my chair and ran a lap around my house. I'm thinking about running for mayor, 2021 is going pretty good.

 I just played a game on principals and salt master was screwing around and put himself in a losing position.

This story ends on a good note, salty continued losing 5 games in a row and started questioning if he deserves to be a titled player because salt master was playing so horrendously.

I happened to be at the right place at the right time. My reward? Salty tears from Grand master salt himself stemming from an unrated blitz game. 

Why am I writing this? I guess because after a great personal moment it would be nice to hear ""GG""  or even ""I have mis played this badly"" instead of ""F@+$+""+("" ing  ngn cheaters screwing up my stream! There's no way a 1500 blitz player can lose to a salt master like me!! ""

Don't get me wrong I cherish the salt, but still.

I've been trying to beat this damn bot for a while now. I usually do well in the start but then I go ahead and blunder so hard. I don't think I've blundered up until this point, and if so, this is the longest ""good start"" I've had against this bot (I'm white). I'm no expert, but as far as I see it, I'm far more developed than black here, and I have a very good configuration, with multiple pawn diagonals (not sure about the technical term). 

So, would you rather be black or white here, and why?",1610098165

919,Loving the Naroditsky speedrun but...,chess,"I wish people in chat would stop accusing opponents of cheating. Danya does an excellent job of explaining why you shouldn't accuse people of cheating, mainly being a feeling of empathy and putting yourself in the other player's shoes. If that was you playing the game of your life, you'd hate for people to assume it was because you were cheating.

As you climb the ranks it is common to see players that seem to excel at certain areas while being deficient at others. It's also common for people that play certain openings/positions very well, but can't play other ones at all. I'm saying this because just because someone knows theory better than Danya, doesn't mean it's cool to accuse them of cheating.

In early parts of the speedrun his opponents often play obscure/dubious openings and it's cool to see how Danya takes advantage of players breaking these principles. It's usually pretty clear they aren't cheating.

Now imagine a player that is higher rated, and is well booked in their openings but deficient elsewhere. Even a GM could absolutely get outplayed early on if they play a line the opponent knows. As a viewer we should take this as an opportunity for another type of learning experience, how do you learn to defend a position and maintain counter-play? You shouldn't give up after the opening because it's very rare people lose here.

I think it's unfair to accuse people who manage to outplay a GM in the opening because they know their theory. There are cheaters out there, but you need more than one game (and especially more than the first 15 moves) to make that call so don't go on a witch-hunt.

I'm loving the sense of community this speedrun teaches and a reminder that there is another person on the other side of that screen. There are cheaters out there, and it's a huge shame but they're in the minority. We should assume most of the community is out there to have fun and learn. Be kind and give them the respect you would want to have.",1610096038

After watching the ending of the Queen's Gambit and marveling at the show's attention to detail I've been wanting to get myself a set like in the ending tournament. Turns out I am not the only one; some googling revealed that the specific set used was a Soviet Latvian style chess set. [Here is one](https://www.reddit.com/r/chessporn/comments/kidgk5/3024x3516_loved_the_latvian_style_set_used_in_the/) showcased on r/chessporn and it seems that the user in that thread [got it off etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GambitStore?section_id=20124088) for a few hundred dollars. That's definitely too expensive for me, but even [searching for the similar Dubrovnik style](https://www.etsy.com/ca/market/dubrovnik_chess_set) gives prices in the $150-$300 range. 

Is there anywhere that sells a set in a similar design for closer to $50-$100? There are plenty of wooden chess sets of seemingly decent quality for under $50, but my guess is those are mass produced, and the ones I'm finding are more expensive since I was looking for a specific style that probably has to be handmade.",1610079955

I usually play 10 minute games (used to be under blitz now it's rapid as of a few months ago so my stats are a bit broken up). After each game I analyze my PGN using LucasChess and stockfish. I like the LucasChess summary and stats.

There's obviously still a game here or there with dumb hanging piece blunders but those are pretty rare now. Some recent games my 'mistakes' look to me like 'computer moves' I'm not sure I would ever see myself, or moves that require a really tight line that would be tough for a human.

What is my best way forward? 15 minute games? Hopefully local clubs will be an option again soon. Any specific books you enjoy? Thanks everyone!

My Analysis:

10 minute Rapid

Rating: 1071

White Pieces Game

&amp;#x200B;

1. e4: control of the d5 and f5 sqaures, fighting for centre control of the board

1. e5: opponents trying to equalise the control of the centre

&amp;#x200B;

2. Nf3: Attacking opponents pawn on e5 to put more pressure on the centre of the board and controlling d4 sqaure for potential pawn push at d4 to attack pawn at e5

2. Nc6: opponent defending this pawn and simultaneously attacking the d4 square

&amp;#x200B;

3. Bb5: attacking the opponents knight defending the e5 pawn trying to push it off its strong position

3. a6: opponent develops pawn over piece to try and rid of my bishop and its threat

&amp;#x200B;

4. Ba4: Not ideal as I move a bishop twice in the opening, losing a move having to move away but still keeping the same threat on the Knight, If Bxc6 than bxc6 and Nxe5 wins a pawn but will be immediately prone to attacks by pawns and less sqaures are occupiable

4. b5: opponents continues to drive off my bishop in an attempt to relieve the Knight but is losing moves that could have been used to develop more pieces

&amp;#x200B;

5. Bb3: Bishop has moved for a third time, not good. Instead now achieves a goal that could have been made on move 3 by attacking the f7 pawn with Bc4

5. Nf6: attacking my e4 pawn and develops a piece

&amp;#x200B;

6. Nc3: defends the attacked e4 pawn, centre control must be kept

6. Bc5: bishop put on nice diagonal with room to retreat and eyes down on my f2 pawn

&amp;#x200B;

7. 0-0: gets Rook into the game and keeps King safe, also removes the threat of Bxf2 as Rxf2 wins a minor piece for a pawn

7. d6: Frees the c8 Bishop and also adds a defender to the e5 pawn to help maintain tension in the centre, Blacks development is superior

&amp;#x200B;

8. Nd5: Knight placed in the centre of the board, protected by e4 pawn and if Nxd5 than exd5 and attacks the c6 Knight and is safe on opponents side of the board

8. Nxd5: Knight is taken from its superior square and is removing whites Knight from the centre

&amp;#x200B;

9. Bxd5: Pins the knight as if it moves the Rook is exposed and Bishop cannot be traded back

9. Engine claims this as a mistake but unsure, I thought it was solid move as it unpins the Knight however if the Knight moves the Bishop is pinned to the Rook, bt if Bxc6, than its even trade with Bxc6

&amp;#x200B;

10. c3: engine claims as missed win but unsure again, attempt to push the d4 pawn attacking the c5 Bishop and attempting to free the c1 Bishop and develop it

10. 0-0: Black castles while it can and keeps king safe

&amp;#x200B;

11. d4: attacks the c5 Bishop and now White has 2 pawns in the centre of the board

11. exd4: removing this pawn from the board, if White chooses to take back than either the bishop or knight attacking the d4 sqaure will be safe to win the pawn as the Knight and Queen will be lost if all possible esxchanges occur and puts black in solid position

&amp;#x200B;

12. cxd4: That possible line was not seen during the game, so 2 pawns are still placed in the centre of the board

12. Bb4: Weak move, doesnt attack any pieces unlike playing a move like Bb6 where it moves to safety and still eyes down at that pawn

&amp;#x200B;

13. Bd2: Attacks the bishop which now has no place to go, if Ba5, than Bishops can trade with Bxb5 but than Nxb5 even trade of Bishops and puts the Knight on the edge of the board making it half a Knight, if Ba3, than bxa3 losing the Bishop to a pawn, and if Bc5, than dxc5 losing the Bishop for a pawn

13. Bxd2: removes the other dark square bishop off the board for an even trade, best move

&amp;#x200B;

14. Qxd2: develops the queen and trade the bishop, Queen protects the d pawn and holds 2 diagonals

14. Rb8: Unclear on what the point of the moves was, maybe to move the knight and keep the Bishop on b7 safe from attack from the d5 Bishop 

&amp;#x200B;

15. Bb3: weak move, removes tension on the board when Rac1 was a better move having two attasckers on the Knight 

15. a5: potential push of the pawn and next move a4 attacks the Bishop forcing White to lose a move and move the Bishop and Pawn cannot be taken

&amp;#x200B;

16. a3: this threat wasn't seen in the game, a4 prevents the attack on the Bishop and after pawns exchange Bishop now again attacks the Knight at c6 safely however it is not pinned

16. b4: offering an exchange of pawns, or if axb4, than a4 is coming but than Rxa4

&amp;#x200B;

17. Ba2: Engine says is excellent but Im unsure why I played it it doesnt do anything to help my position if anything I think it worsens it as it blocks the Rook from having an open file in the next few moves

17. bxa3: removes White's a pawn and is far into White's side, but this is easily dealt with

&amp;#x200B;

18. bx13: White retakes the pawn and blocks the a5 pawn from advancing 

18. Qf6: 

&amp;#x200B;

976,Attacking Chess - How do you avoid running out of steam?,chess,"Hi, this SR was very helpful the last time I asked a question here and it helped me improve my game. I'm hoping you might be able to offer some words of wisdom once again. 

I love playing attacking chess, but I often find myself moments away from what feels like victory, only to miss a crucial move for the win. I can sacrifice pieces effectively in order to tear open their defenses, and quickly mobilise my pieces to surround their king. But it's in the final moments when I'm trying to manouver around their defences that I often just run out of steam, and end up opting to continue developing.

1004,My ideas on a chess notebook/handwritten notes,chess,"Hello everybody.

First of all, none of the products i mention in here are affiliated in any kind of way. Just things that I use, or think about :-)

I'm a very beginner level chess player. Around 1200 on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org). But nevertheless I am really starting to invest time into getting better. One thing I really love to memorize things, like specific openings or tactical motives, are handwritten notes. 

So I started to think about an idea of how it would be nice and easy to make it possible to have an opportunity of creating diagrams of board position, instead of just PGN like notation of games or positions.

I found an article on [chess.com](https://chess.com) which gave me a really astonishing inspiration of how an easy hand written notation on a board could look like. But I didn't think, that it was convenient to have to carry around glue and scissors, to cut out the boards and glue them into a notebook site.

I've been using Arc notebooks for a long time, and the one I use, got a little pocket for small sheets of paper or post its or something like this. (e.g. [https://www.amazon.de/Staples-Customizable-Leather-Notebook-System/dp/B00E2548RU](https://www.amazon.de/Staples-Customizable-Leather-Notebook-System/dp/B00E2548RU)). So it would be nice to have pre-cut boards which would stick on a piece of paper without having to carry around glue, when you want to note something while you travel. (I am using lots of public transport)

Next idea I came across with, was to use squared labels (e.g. [https://www.amazon.de/Etiketten-Label-Quadratisch-Tintenstrahl-Laserdrucker/dp/B071X6SDYN](https://www.amazon.de/Etiketten-Label-Quadratisch-Tintenstrahl-Laserdrucker/dp/B071X6SDYN)) but there are lots of different sizes etc. Maybe I do even want to use 65mm squares on one kind of study and then use lots of smaller diagrams to get more on one site if I need it.

I am a professional software engineer, so I started to work on a software, to generate PDF-Files, based on the horizontal and vertical margins, as well as the gaps of the squares on such a label paper. An example is attached here, and it is very easy customizable. So I can easily print it, pre-cut it and carry it with my notebook, which fits easily into any kind of bag/backpack/suitcase.

If you are interested in this PDF-Generator, let me know. I am willing to share it :-)

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise: What are your thoughts on it? Do have have better handable solutions? Do you think a handwritten journal for chess is even convenient or a waste of time?

Should I be using spaced repetition? Or perhaps I should do 'cycles' of the same small set like the Woodpecker method suggests? What difficulty - blitz? Hard?

**Here's what I'm thinking for a training plan. I'll split my time like this:**

20% playing games

20% solving hard mixed puzzles (to train calculation ability / how to find what the best move actually is)

20% solving easy or blitz puzzles sorted by motif (to sort of 'burn in' specific patterns that aren't supposed to be difficult, just to be instantly seen). I'm not so sure about this one; chess books always seem to be sorted by motif, but I don't really know why.

20% solving a spaced repetition custom set of problems I got wrong on chesstempo (spaced repetition seems like it'd be most useful here, so I can eventually get through the custom set and get focus on the things that always trip me up).

20% watching YouTube videos like John Bartholomew's beginner series and doing lessons on chess.com

1063,The takeback trick,chess,"Suppose you are absolutely killing it in a game and here you make some stupid blunder or a misclick. You are on lichess and request a takeback, and as we live on a planet with people fueled by altruism and love they readily accept the takeback. Except no, you may be sure that the person will instead of accepting the takeback look at what is precisely the problem is that made you want to take it back. He searches and finds, then he plays and takes his points. Now this always bothered me and made me all pessimistic about human nature and all but there is a fun way to turn this around. Get yourself a move that looks like a blunder and request a takeback. The person will think: ""ah he wants to take back his mive so where is the blunder, ah there a free knight!"" amd he takes it. This is opposed to when you don't request a takeback; ""hah, a free knight why would he do that, is it safe, will I get mated again?"". Now I have had great succes with rhis takeback trick ""its like the oh no my knight from IMrosen"" and the best thing is that you trick selfish people. It feels great because you made a winning idea and delivered justice for not accepting a takeback.",1610027359

1069,Aren't opening stats skewed,chess,"You know how you can use an opening explorer and it might say White wins 40%, Black 30, and 30% draws.  It strikes me this is probably skewed in that it doesn't take into consideration the possibility that the average ratings of one side being higher than the other -- I'm going to guess for instance an opening this might occur in is the Budapest Gambit, which might be more likely to be played by lower rated players. 

Anyway, might not the solution would be to take a percentage of the difference of ratings and multiply it by  the actual percentage, to get the ""adjusted"" percentage.  This could lead to some skewing too when the rating difference is quite large so some sort of use of logarithm(s) might be in order.

Intermediate player here, though only recently came into online chess and love the scene. I especially love the puzzle modes on lichess and chess/com as it gives such a fantastic way to practice positions and pattern recognition.

I started getting into puzzle rush and hit about 22 completed puzzles on the 5 min timer. Then I noticed the leaderboards and saw that actually that isn't even anywhere near a 'good' score- and THEN I searched for videos of GMs doing it.

Oh. My. God.

I cannot fathom how insanely fast GMs can process these puzzles! Watching the Hikaru video above, it seems like he solves the puzzle before I can even register which colour it is to play or where any pieces are. The visual/mental processing speed is INSANE! I don't even know if a computer could solve these any faster if given the same visual input.

I was wondering, why does the rating start at +0? Is this because...

1. The rating is *normalised* to start at +0 by definition? That it is, it was hard-coded by whoever programmed the engine.

2. It is not hard-coded in any way, but effectively a conclusion that the engine comes to independently, effectively as an estimate that, with perfect play, the game is expected to end in a draw?

3. Something else entirely?

I imagine this would be engine-dependent, i.e. for alphazero the answer would have to be (2)... if alphazero does indeed estimate a +0 at game start.",1610544449

1. **e4** **c5** 2. **Nf3** **d6** 3. **d4** **cxd4** 4. **Nxd4** **Nf6** 5. **Nc3** 

Playing g6 (the dragon), gives black only a winrate of about 28%, and white 48%,

Meanwhile playing a6 (najdorf) gives black and white about equal odds at 37% vs 39%.

Am i overlooking something here or is The dragon simply an inferior opening, and I'd be better of learning the Najdorf? Thank you.",1610530492

Consider the exchange variation: 3...a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6

Now at this point, white can't win the pawn with 5. Nxe5 (although I've played plenty of games where people will try) as this is met with 5...Qd4.

So here's my question:

If white can't win the pawn, then what is the motivation for attacking the knight in the first place? Or even what is the motivation for attacking the pawn in the first place? White knows the pawn is not winnable, so why try? There must be a different motivation for white here, what exactly is that motivation?

(I of course understand that white has doubled black's pawns at the cost of the bishop pair, and the position is roughly equal at this point)",1610526914

There have been lots of piece blunders in my games and while I keep climbing the rating ladder, the blunders haven’t seemed to slow down! I’m wondering if this is because of the rating inflation that happened a while ago but the blunders have to stop eventually right? I feel like there’s no way GMs are blundering pieces against each other in 10 minute games. If they’re blundering pieces too what sets them apart from regular players? I don’t know, if anyone has an answer to why blunders keep happening in my games even as I climb 200+ points higher, please let me know.",1610515453

I've always played Chess but never took it seriously, but by the end of November 2020, I started taking Chess seriously. I always try to warm up using puzzles and attempt to complete 20-30 before I play a live game; while I believe it might help, I still lose uncontrollably. I scanned through some of the similar questions on this subreddit and kept noticing replies stating that one should take a break from actually playing and stick to studying. But I don't exactly know what studying is, can you recommend some ways I can study. And I know this is asking too much, but if anyone is bored and seeking something to do, I would really appreciate it if anyone can look at my games and maybe provide tips and suggestions I can use in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been an avid chess player going on 6 years now and this year with the chess boom I have definitely felt it.

At the Start of the year 2020 I was hovering around 1200, now I am a solid 1350 and i got as high as 1400. I don't think its because I necessarily got better this year at chess but more the flood of plebians coming in has thrust me above the 1200 base rating scrub waves. 

There were definitely some games in my quick rise against 1200+ players that did not have the grasp of what I feel a 1200 has. Trying to 4 move mate me, for example., thats more of a 900-1000 type style I have experienced.

I'm not a big fan of the Sicilian Defense myself, though I know it is considered one of the strongest responses from black, so I occasionally play it... but not often (I welcome any other suggestions for good openings for black)

As of recently, I've been trying to go back to the classic e4, e5 opening again. This game featured such opening.

[https://www.chess.com/game/live/6162261138](https://www.chess.com/game/live/6162261138)

&amp;#x200B;

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. d4 h6 7. Nf3 Bg4 8.

dxe5 Be6 9. Nc3 Nxc3 10. Qxd8+ Rxd8 11. Bxe6 Rd1# 0-1

&amp;#x200B;

I was very satisfied with how I Checkmated my opponent in this game and, to be honest, I didn't really expect that I was gonna end up having a chance to Checkmate him after I captured his Knight on C3. What I had foreseen was that this trade seemed to work fine and didn't de-stabilize my position.... but then after he took my Queen, I decided to take with my rook, and then after Bishop took on e6, I saw that I had Checkmate with the rook.

&amp;#x200B;

But this post isn't simply to indulge in my ""awesomeness"". I'm also interested in seeing the moments when my opponent could have played a better move and gotten the advantage. I thought that on move 8, when he took on e5, that was a dangerous moment because if I took his knight on f3, he could capture with queen and I would have the bishop and the queen attacking my knight on d5 (not to mention, the queen and the bishop would be eyeing the F7 square, threatening checkmate. I played Bishop to e6 to prevent that 

That said, what are some of the things my opponent could have played? Are there any?",1609969611

[https://lichess.org/y73CdMKkXR31](https://lichess.org/y73CdMKkXR31)

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 { C41 Philidor Defense } Bg4 4. dxe5 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4 Nf6 7. Qb3 Qe7 8. Nc3 Nc6 9. Qxb7 Rd8 10. Qxc6+ Nd7 11. Nd5 Qh4 12. Nxc7+ Ke7 13. Ne6 Re8 14. Bg5+ Qxg5 15. Nxg5 Rb8 16. O-O-O Rxb2 17. Kxb2 Nb8 18. Qb7+ Ke8 19. Bxf7# { White wins by checkmate. } 1-0 

We mirrored Morphy and the Duke through my first 8 moves, and black deviated by blundering, which I was able to take advantage of thanks to learning the ideas behind the moves, as well as deploying the patented long castle threat later on. Ironically the move I was most proud of was suboptimal, the Knight trap on move 13 which set up a mate trap as well as the fork that won the queen. The only thing I would change is my very un-Morphy-like material greed on moves 17 and 18 when I had mate in 2.

1317,Have there been instances when players have lied about rating and managed to get a title?,chess,"Hi all, 

I know that this question sounds ridiculous but please bear with me. Just recently, I found out that someone I knew had obtained the title of Candidate Master and thought that he had crossed 2200 rating, as he stated that his peak FIDE rating was 2250+. However, when I went to look at his FIDE rating card to see what tournaments he had played in, I was surprised to see his peak rating was just slightly below 2200. I thought it was a bit suspicious that he would lie about his peak FIDE rating when he has no reason to, but also could not come up with any plausible explanation as to why he would. I tried to check if the tournaments he had played in gave FIDE titles for good performances but did not find any mention of this in the websites. That's why I am so confused as to how he got his CM title, surely FIDE would have records of his rating to determine whether he crosses the 2200 benchmark of CM right? Apart from these two criteria, are there any of which I am unaware of, or if I got these wrong?

**TIMESTAMP: 15 minutes into the video.** 

Here, Dubov plays King to F3, which leads to him eventually losing. 

HOWEVER, if he had played Knight to G5, he may have won. Two scenarios could have played out if he did that: 

1. Rajabov plays King to H8 -&gt; Dubov plays Queen to H7 and wins. 
2. Rajabov plays King to G8 -&gt; Dubov plays Queen to D8 -&gt; Rajabov sacrifices his Queen -&gt; Dubov eventually wins.

Below average patzer here, ~1600 blitz on Lichess.

In a recent 53 move 5 + 3 blitz game I noticed the Centipawn Loss of 9 with two mistakes, which seems odd. It wasn't a great game; my opponent blundered two pieces in the opening which is how I managed the high score; it still seems strange since the game was 50+ moves. Maybe any move was good at that point(?). 

How accurate are those numbers? Is it super low depth like chess.com ""accuracy.""

I became more interested in chess and have been wanting to get back into it for quite a while now and recently have finally started learning and playing again. 

When I mentioned my interest in starting learning chess again a couple years ago, my dad was very discouraging and said things like, “you should’ve never given up when you were a young kid, you’re too old to take chess seriously now.” While I know that’s not true, I think it still sort of got into my head. 

I’m the type of person who needs a clear (ambitious but possible) long-term goal to stay motivated, and I’d love to play in OTB tournaments in the future.

Bit more info, if this helps

I've played the English Opening for 3-4 years. But recently I've been looking into the Vienna and London.

My black openings haven't had much theory behind them for a while. Typically I either just mirrored them for a bit and play natural moves or I did the Sicilian (since I knew the English, it was fairly similar). Now I am learning the Caro Kann. 

I'm bad at the middle game. I tend to blunder a piece (or pawn if I'm lucky). I dont think my raw calculation/visualization ability is where it needs to be, but it could also just be I dont spend enough time when I need to. I almost always end with more time than when I started. I think pretty good at endgames. I've started playing blindfolded a little bit. I cant make it a whole game, but I tend to have a general idea where everything is throughout the game. I'm unrated officially, but I play online and/or do puzzles daily. I want to be as strong as possible before my first tournament.

1438,10 simple steps to improve at chess,chess,"Here’s my promise to you - follow these 10 steps and you will go from an absolute beginner to a competent 1200-rated online player. This is a step-by-step guide to improving at chess.

The steps do take work, but not too much. It’s more about consistency - putting in a bit of time every day. I’m envisioning that you won’t do everything at once - it should take at least a couple of weeks, if not months, to work through the steps.

I’ve included [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) resources below because that’s what I’m most familiar with, but you can also find many of the same tools on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/). These are the two most popular platforms for playing chess online and either is a fine starting point.

If you’re familiar with a step already you can skip it (probably most will skip steps one or two). I wrote this because it’s the journey I’ve taken this past year and I wanted to make it easier for others who might come across this post. It may not work for everyone but I think it’s very practical.

# Step one: learn how the pieces move.

Go to [https://lichess.org/learn](https://lichess.org/learn) and work through the first four sections listed - Chess Pieces, Fundamentals, Intermediate and Advanced. This will give you all the information you need to play a game of chess.

# Step two: learn algebraic notation.

This is absolutely key to reading anything about chess and honestly takes ten minutes to learn. I reckon [this blog from Chess House](https://blog.chesshouse.com/how-to-read-and-write-algebraic-chess-notation/) is a good step-by-step resource for understanding algebraic notation.

You can [also practice naming the different board coordinates on Lichess](https://lichess.org/training/coordinate) once you’ve learnt them.

# Step three: watch the first video in John Bartholomew’s ‘Chess Fundamentals’ series.

John Bartholomew is an international chess master who makes instructional YouTube videos. I’m an unashamed fanboy and I really think [this first video in his series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao9iOeK_jvU&amp;t=1470s), on undefended pieces, is critical in giving new players a basic game plan.

When I tried to play chess over the years I always grew frustrated because it felt random - I would place my pieces on squares and eventually lose them, and then the game was over.

But this video teaches you to play with one goal in mind - making sure pieces are defended each time you move them. For me it made the game less overwhelming - all I had to do was defend my pieces - and was a gateway into chess proper.

You don’t need to watch the other videos in the series yet. The first is enough to get the ball rolling and you can come back to the others (they’re all very useful). It’s a long video, but I think it’s worth it.

# Step four: play a few games!

You know how the pieces move and have a very basic game plan - now it’s time to play a few games of chess. On the main chess sites there are different ‘time controls’ (how long the game will go for). You will see numbers like 3+0, 5+2 and 15+10.

The first number is how many minutes each player gets to make their moves, and the second number is the ‘increment’ - after each move, you get that many seconds added to your overall time. So in a 15+10 game, you have 15 minute to make your moves, plus 10 seconds for each move you make.

Ideally, you want to play slower time controls (at least 15+10) so you have time to think about the moves you make. **This is highly recommended for chess improvement**.

You also want to play against real people, not computers. This can be scary at first, and you are guaranteed to lose your first five or six games if you’re totally new, but after those games your ELO (rating of how good you are) will be more accurate and you’ll be matched with other beginners. Computers don’t make ‘human’ moves and you won’t learn much by playing them.

From this point on, **I’m assuming you’re mixing some gameplay in with each step as you go**. You want to give yourself the chance to practice and implement the ideas you’re learning at each step without overloading yourself.

# Step five: learn the opening principles.

The part of chess that seems to captivate most beginners is the opening - that if you just memorise the first few moves you’ll win more games. But that’s absolutely not the case. Going down the rabbit hole of openings will restrict your chess improvement because it’s very unlikely you’ll get to use your opening knowledge against other beginners. They won’t play the theoretical moves because they don’t know them and you’ll quickly be in unfamiliar waters.

At this stage, **all you need to know are the opening principles which will serve you well no matter what your opponent plays**.

[This video explains the basic opening principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kURU67G98O8), but they can also be summarised as:

* Control the centre of the board (usually by playing out your d and e pawns).
* Develop your minor pieces (these are your bishops and knights, and developing means bringing them off the back rank and into the game proper. Developing these pieces also supports the first opening principle of controlling the centre).
* Get your king to safety (almost always by castling, especially as a beginner).

# Step six: learn the three most basic checkmates.

There are three checkmate patterns that will come up for your entire chess career - the ladder mate, checkmating a lone king with your king and queen, and checkmating a lone king with your king and rook.

They’re not difficult to learn and are critical to winning many games as a beginner. Learn the theory of these mates ([queen and king video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3SVorXyxkw), [rook and king video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtGVYnv91ps), [ladder mate video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIi6DHpr8hM&amp;ab_channel=CoachDat)) and practice these endgames using the [Chess Endgame Trainer](https://chess-endgame-trainer.firebaseapp.com/position/0/0/0) (which is also available as an Android app).

You can practice queen + king mates [here](https://chess-endgame-trainer.firebaseapp.com/list/0/0), rook + king mates [here](https://chess-endgame-trainer.firebaseapp.com/list/0/1) and ladder mates [here](https://chess-endgame-trainer.firebaseapp.com/list/0/2). You will stalemate the opponent many times. It happens! I still do it all the time.

# Step seven: begin to practice tactics.

**This is where it gets really fun, in my opinion**.

The first thing to do is [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phbYrGwgjHk) which gives a good overview of the main tactical motifs, or patterns. Tactics are usually forcing moves or sequences that net you material. You might have heard of some of them - like a knight fork or a discovered attack.

Then you want to start practicing tactics on a daily basis. This is absolutely critical to chess improvement. Tactics will be the main thing to decide your games until you’re at least at a rating of 1500. And practicing tactics is what will help you improve the fastest.

My recommendation is the app ‘Chess Tactics for Beginners’ ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chessking.android.learn.ctforbeginners&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US), [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chess-tactics-for-beginners/id1142551734)). I think it’s great because it separates out the tactics into different motifs (e.g. mate in one, discovered attack, skewer) which means you know what you’re looking for - just giving you an extra helping hand as a beginner. It also increases in difficulty as you progress, starting from mate-in-one and going from there. I did this app for 30 minutes a day and finished the entire thing. During that time my rating went from \~800 on Lichess to \~1200. The app costs money but you can try it for free. The UI is janky but it’s a really good app.

Some general tips on solving tactics/puzzles - your aim should always be to work out how the puzzle will end before you make your first move. This trains your calculation ability - how well you can calculate what’s going to happen and what moves will be made. You don’t want to make a move, see what the opponent does and go from there (it’s a bad habit for real games).

This isn’t always possible as a beginner and sometimes the opponent (computer in this case) will make a move you didn’t see or don’t understand. But it’s a good goal. I also wouldn’t spend more than five minutes on any individual puzzle - it’s about exposing you to tactical ideas not 100 per cent accuracy, so if after five minutes you haven’t got it then make your best guess and return to the puzzle later if you get it wrong.

Most of the main chess sites also have puzzle sections which are perfectly fine - the difference is you can’t always sort by motif, so you’ll be looking at mixed puzzles which could have any idea in them. That’s really useful once you know all the patterns well and want to practice like it’s a real game, but can be trickier when you’re just starting out.

# Step eight: learn a couple of basic openings.

Now you’ve got some fundamental principles under your belt, it’s time to learn a little more about openings.

The classic advice is that as white you want to play an e4 opening. This usually leads to open games (where there’s space in the middle of the board) which let you practice the tactical ideas you’ve been learning. The Italian game and the Ruy Lopez (which is also known as the Spanish game) are the most popular e4 openings. I’d suggest choosing either of these to use. Here’s a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHGmHXEtIE) on the Italian, and [another on the Ruy Lopez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41rPFNY_CAY).

**What you don’t want to do is memorise ‘lines’ or sequences of moves beyond the first three or four**. Almost everyone at a beginner level will leave theory behind very early and your investment in memorisation won’t be useful. Stick to the opening principles and they’ll serve you well. The point of those videos is rather to give you a rough idea of some ideas you might pursue in each opening (e.g. going after a weak square, or attacking the kingside).

As black, I’d suggest meeting e4 with e5 and d4 with d5 and just playing off principles for now. Sometimes you will fall into an opening trap which can be painful - check it out after the game with the computer, learn one move you could have played differently, and move on. Over time you won’t fall into these traps and your opening knowledge will grow organically.

# Step nine: read a book.

Not just any book. The book I recommend highly is ‘Logical Chess: Move By Move’ by Irning Chernev. Countless people here recommend it as a first book and for good reason. It is very accessible, written in plain language, and is highly instructive for why certain moves get made and the sorts of things you should be thinking about as a first step beyond tactics and opening principles.

It’s also good for the organic growth of your opening knowledge - you will see how grandmasters play against certain openings and what they might be thinking about with the moves they play.

Take Chernev’s words with a grain of salt - he’s trying to get you to think in a particular way and with particular rules which are really useful for a beginner, but which you’ll eventually learn to break (e.g. moving the pawns around the kingside).

You can play the book out on a real board or online. You might also try to guess the next move for black and why they make that move (active learning as opposed to just passively reading).

The insight it gives you into the thoughts of a good player is also useful for the next step, which is ...

# Step ten: analyse your games.

**Now you’re really progressing as a chess player - you know opening principles, some tactical ideas and a few endgame concepts**.

The final step, which might be the most important of all, is to analyse your games after you’ve played them. What you’re doing is basically what Irning Chernev does in Logical Chess - noting down why you made the moves you did, what you were thinking at the time and whether there might have been other options.

Annotation can get very in-depth but I’d suggest starting simple - for the critical moves you make, write down why you made them. See if you can identify mistakes in your game or your thought process. Did the opponent make a move you didn’t expect? That’s worth noting too.

Then once you’ve gone through the game, write down one thing you learned from it. I wouldn’t spend more than 20 minutes on this whole process. Then (only then!) turn on the engine, go through the game again and see where the computer would have played things differently. I’m mainly looking here for mistakes in the opening (growing my organic knowledge of openings) and tactics that I missed (I snip mine out and put them in a flashcard app so I can look at them later).

You can organise your annotated games with a Lichess study. I have about 40 studies because I split mine by opening and win/loss (e.g. games where I won with the Italian and those I lost with the Italian - repeat for every opening). But you can organise them however you like.

# That’s it!

Congrats! You’ve completed these ten steps to improving at chess. From here you should have a solid foundation to grow into an intermediate player, though you’re probably a little stronger in tactics than other areas if you’ve followed the steps exactly. Common next moves include learning more about endgames ([book recommendation here](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/100_Endgames_You_Must_Know.html?id=gXtpCwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y)) and ‘positional’ chess ([book recommendation here](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Winning_Chess_Strategies.html?id=35PaDwAAQBAJ&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y)).

1442,Attacking vs defending strategies for lower rated players,chess,"Hi, I'm not very strong at attacking and often times I either miscalculate, over extend my pieces / pawns or I just straight up blunder a piece because I'm so focused on the attack. I was wondering if instead of attacking, a defensive strategy might be a good idea for lower rated players?

&amp;#x200B;

So I setup my pieces and basically give the attack to my opponent and hope they overextend their pieces or blunder a piece / miscalculate? I know against strong rated opponents this strategy probably wouldn't work because they'll just continue building up the pressure and your pieces will probably be over worked and your defence will crack, but against lower rated opponents I've found they don't tend to mobilise all their pieces in the attack and usually end up overextending the few pieces they do have out on the board. 

And psychologically they think they're winning because you're defending and they're attacking so they push their pushes further into your camp which often ends up with a piece of their being trapped.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing chess seriously for 2 years, on and off for months at a time (maybe 1 year of dedicated playing). I'm currently rated 1800 in Bullet, 1900 in Blitz, and 2000 in Rapid on Lichess. I've been stuck here for a few months, so probably plateau'ed, without further guidance.

Does anyone around or past this rating have advice for how they studied, around this rating range, to improve?

I discovered them at the end of the movie ‘Pawn Sacrifice’, and wanted to get one so I could have a book and a chess set to study positions and themes while I was, say, out and about on public transport or in a restaurant.

The problem with a chess set I got recently is that there’s no pocket/sleeve for pieces that get captured and removed off the board - this means that, for a chess set that is supposed to be convenient for travellers, it offers quite a conundrum - where to put pieces that have been captured! If you were at home or in bed, perhaps it isn’t the end of the world, but figuring out where to place captured pieces on packed public transport is like knowing when to push f5 as White after developing. 

Does anyone know of any magnetic travel chess sets that do offer a sleeve/pocket to put captured pieces in? I’m currently looking at this one as a replacement:

1549,Opening move popularity,chess,"I am profoundly confused by the great disparity of opening move popularity. According to any database I know of, the most popular first moves are: e4, d4, Nf3, c4, usually in that order. For amateur/online play, maybe swap Nf3 and c4.

And I can totally see that those are good first moves. I struggle however to see that d4 is *four times* more popular than Nf3/c4 in master play and almost *10 times* more popular for online casuals. 

Why is that? There is some consensus that any decent opening leads to a draw with correct play; to put it very simple, all of the above moves are 'equally strong'. They also do perform very similar in practice, across virtually all rating ranges. So I would assume that they should be also equally popular, but they are not. Is there any explanation for that? I could maybe agree that c4 can feel a little clunky because it does not directly help piece develop and also potentially concedes the Kingside to Black. But what's wrong with 1.Nf3? We develop a piece, deny 1...e5. We did not occupy the center with a pawn *yet*, but it's impossible for Black to prevent both 2.e4 and 2.d4, so even if you consider the pawn center a priority, either pawn will get there soon. So why does virtually everybody prefer 1.4 or 1.d4 over any of the alternatives?",1609848105

1553,Progress in nine months,chess,"Hey everyone,

Six months ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/hhtgyc/progress_in_three_months/) outlining the first three months of progress I'd made as a complete adult beginner coming to the game fresh (I'd only played a few games ever, and didn't know about castling or en passant). Then three months ago I did [another update](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/j4xrds/my_progress_in_six_months/). Figured I'd keep these going because it's quite fun to document chess progress and hopefully others might find it useful.

**About me**: I work full-time in a fairly busy/stressful job, but the hours are reasonable (typically 9-5 and weekdays). I play almost exclusively online, a few games here and there OTB with friends. I play on Lichess, so the ratings below are for that platform.

**Started chess**: 11th March 2020. So about nine months ago.

**Blitz rating**: My lowest rating was 822, my peak rating is 1510, and my current rating is about 1470. I’ve played 1700 games of blitz.

**Rapid rating**: My lowest rating was 1088, my peak rating is 1650, and I’ve played about 260 games of rapid.

**Time spent playing on Lichess**: I’ve played for 16 days.

**Lichess puzzle rating**: 2200 from about 500 puzzles (but I think this is a little inflated given the recent puzzle changes).

**Chesstempo puzzle rating**: 1640.

**What I've been doing for the past three months:**

* I've continued trying to develop my positional chess understanding but I've given up on the Amateur's Mind for the moment, which I'd been working through. I found Silman's writing style frustrating and it felt like a chore to read. So I'm going with Winning Chess Strategies instead and will see how it goes.
* In my games I've been more focused on trying to play the position and make 'solid' moves rather than speculative/flashy ones. It has cost me a few games where I've missed a key tactical idea but that's the price of learning! Overall it does feel like things are more solid and in control throughout the game. That said, I have a big problem converting - will often have positions of +5 or more in the middlegame which slowly eke away to nothing. Any advice on fixing this would be hugely appreciated!
* I've consolidated a few endgame weaknesses - I'm competent at the basic mates and have also covered concepts like two weaknesses and some pawn ideas. But I would say I'm definitely weakest at endgames and this should probably be an area of focus for me over the next few months.
* Overall, I haven't felt like I've actually learnt that much in the past three months compared with the previous six where everything was new and different, but my rating is still going up so I think I just need to keep plugging away and getting experience in a variety of different positions.
* I still do almost zero opening work except about a half hour of prep for a weekly tournament game I play (45+45). Don't plan on changing much here for a while yet.

At the end of the next three months (one year of playing) I would love to hit 1800 Rapid and by the end of 2021, 2000 Rapid. That's the dream anyway. How has your progress been in 2020 and what do you want to do in 2021?",1609847321

The mistake was 18. Ba6... my idea was sac bishop to chase queen away from Black's second rank. This allows 19. Nxe7+ and what unfolds up to 22. Rxc6 which leaves me up a pawn with a strategic advantage.

1579,"Stress, anxiety, and depression: A vicious cycle of my exhausting relationship with online chess.",chess,"I love chess... And I hate that I love it. I had always played the game growing up, but I only started taking it somewhat seriously in 2017. I progressed my rating from a cute 600 to a mediocre 1500. Watching my growth has been satisfying, but at a cost.

When I started playing chess I held myself to no standards. I expected nothing from myself, and therefore I could not disappoint. Stumbling through basic chess theory and applying what I could glean from YouTube videos and various websites was fun to me. The occasional win was incredibly validating and losing over and over again never bothered me.

Fast forward to today... I cannot for the life of me recall the amount of times I have lost a game, and immediately rage-quit, deleted all chess related apps, bookmarks, and material from my device/computer, vowing never to play again for the sake of my mental health. The stress that overcomes me after losing a series of games literally ruins my mood for the next couple hours. I put so much pressure on myself to achieve greater and execute with near-perfect precision. My expectations of myself are irrational, and it’s destroying my relationship with the game. 

I’ve had similar experiences with other competitive online games. Watching my kill/death ratio and score/min in FPS evoked a similar set of emotions, which ultimately forced me to quit playing all together. 

I don’t expect to be a grandmaster, or even ever play chess on a serious competitive level. I simply want to enjoy the game again. 

TL;DR: I get easily tilted playing online chess and I want to have fun playing the game again.

His power went out and so I won the game on time. This caused my rating to go up almost 500 points to over 850. The website put me against a few 900-1000 rating players and I lost every game, dropping my rating to 681. 

Now the website keeps putting me against 600-900 rating players. I've lost 5 games in a row and my rating hasn't changed a single point - it's been 681 for the last 5 games. 

This is dumb. How do I get a rating that's viable?",1609828286

The column would have been published around 2010.

1598,I know this isn’t even an achievement but I just hit 1000 from being a 600ish player on everything at chess.com in 31 days! Here’s how:,chess,"I finally made it in the 1000s range for all type of play on the website!!!! Fair warning I am on winter break so this is all I do, hence the 31 days. My daily rating is around 1200 but not counting that because there’s practically no time control for moves. 1000 may be the worst rating in the world but it means a lot to me :) 

I wanted to help other people in my situation (if there’s anyone rated as low on here lol), so this is basically what happened. 

I knew the rules of chess and a bit about playing, as in avoid captures, and that’s all. No opening knowledge, no tactics, nothing. So naturally I was at 600 for the longest time. The most important part though, was that I didn’t really care. I think I enjoyed moving pieces when I got bored and really didn’t enjoy the game. If you’re on this sub though, this hopefully isn’t the case with you. Don’t play if you’re not interested! 

Then obviously, like everyone else, I watched the queens gambit. I fully knew that this would cause me to get interested in chess. And sure enough it felt like an epiphany. I don’t know how to explain it but I suddenly figured out how to play. 10 days later I was at 800. Thank you Queen’s Gambit.  

I consider myself below average at “chess intelligence”. So it’s not about me being any kind of smart. I’m sure y’all will take much less time. 

So what I did/ tips! 

1.) Figuring out how to play as black. I was dreadful as black. I didn’t know what to do. If you’re much much worse at one side than another, then you need to flip the board and learn it. Many times I’d play a type of game where I’d forget that my queen wasn’t where I thought it would be because the setup is flipped! Learn the coordinates from both sides. 

2.) Ideally learn an opening for e4 and d4, white and black both. A few variations of what your opponent could respond. Don’t go crazy though, you simply will not be able to remember every opening. Just develop your pieces well enough in every game, respond logically.

3.) Blunders: oh I still make many. But I have drastically reduced in the past month. I’ve nearly stopped hanging pieces. I’m at the 1 and 2 move blunder stage where I miss a ridiculously easy tactic. BUT ALSO remember that your opponent is making a ton of blunders too! To miss a blunder is also  a blunder. If reverse psych works on you, think of your move and simply think that it doesn’t work, and find why. If you can’t think of why, go for it!

4.) Make note of what’s pinned as it happens and try to unpin. So many times I’ve calculated and found that a “defender” was actually pinned and I lost material :(

5.) Everyone’s favorite: tactics. Chesstempo.com and puzzle rush are extremely important. If you don’t see them you won’t recognize them in games. I went crazy today and did 100 but generally 15-20 a day. 

6.) Do not chess fatigue. I’m a hypocrite saying this but if you’re on a losing streak, stop playing. I know you’re losing rating points but you won’t gain any but playing super tired. If you notice yourself getting foggy after 10 blitz games, stop. 

7.) Personally I’m on winning streaks as soon as I wake up. Fresh mind. Losing streaks in the afternoon. Must be the food. 

8.) YouTube for opening videos, lichess analysis board for checking variations

I haven’t done any chess books yet, I’m waiting till 1200 for those. Literally don’t even have an opening in respond to d4, I play d5 and then from there whatever. 

I will update for every milestone just so that maybe someone else can benefit. If someone else wants to add stuff particularly for this 1000 level please do.",1609820547

I assume they do be cause they blunder programmatically, but I don't know if it's a big deal.)

To further elaborate, I'd say I'm at probably 1000 rating but I don't really know. I play the bots because I enjoy not having to worry about a time limit or having to abandon the game if I'm interupted. I'm not trying to become world champion or anything but was curious?

Now I can't get lessons 3 times a week so I gotta do it by myself, so my plan is to do 20 minutes of checkmates + 20 minutes of different tactics and then study a game or two (or playing and analyzing a game or two) for 3 or 4 days a week plus one day of lessons.

Where I struggle is when people break these principles. I regularly lose to a scholar's mate opening, not in the usual fashion but I seem to almost try too hard to punish my opponent and end up leaving pieces hanging. Similarly, if their bishop comes out before their knight, such as in the Bowdler Attack, I struggle also. 

Do these kinds of openings just require study, or are there general rules of thumb I can follow in order to ensure I can punish my opponent?

1743,Would you trade a queen for a second king?,chess,"Let's suppose you can trade in some of your pieces at the start of the game to get a second king. You're not obligated to move when either of your kings is under attack, as long as you have two kings on the board. You can move into check if you wish. When one of your kings is captured, you're now subject to the normal rules of check and checkmate. 

You can decide where to place your second king among the squares of the pieces you traded away. Your second king can only castle if you traded your queen, after which your second king would be on d1 or d8.

Would you trade in a *queen* for a second king?

I have an example below, sorry if my explanation is poor.  My first thought was Zwischenzug but I think that applies mainly to single in-between moves.

For example, White's Rook wants to be on square C.  But she wants to get there with initiative.  So she goes first to square A, forcing a response of the opposing Queen currently on X to square Y.  Then Rook goes to B, forcing Queen to Z.  However, Rook lands on C and Queen has to go back to X!  So White has moved for free tempo.  The reshuffling was simply for this purpose.",1609744818

1771,Gourmet Burger (D.King) vs McDonalds (A.Radic),chess,"Once again I enjoyed tremendously Daniel King's explanation of the exciting first game on day two in the finals between Aronian and Radjabov.

The critical moment of the game was here. Aronian played a brilliant concept with e5 sacrificing his rook. With precise play, Radjabov could have refuted the attack with the brilliant 21...d3!!  


*Processing img 7ndpb1bhg8961...*

The difference is very nice but very subtle. This is what chess beauty is all about. King is able to explain this and make us appreciate the real chess pleasure of such little things. Black is better off making a pawn disappear so the move 21...d3!! wins but 21...dxe3 doesn't because it leaves the f4 pawn where it is.

So again, yeah King is able to explain this by comparing the move d3 with what happened in the game and going down the critical path and comparing the two positions.

Obviously I got curious to see how the infamous Agadmator would handle this explanation. In short...he didn't. He just saw the computer said ...d3 was a good move, mentioned it without a hint of understanding and then copied some line from the computer where white all of a sudden goes fxe3 instead of Levon's idea of Bd3 as played in the game. The line he showed was of course per se correct but once again we see WHY a quality presenter is needed to understand such subtleties, the only way is to compare the same plan (Bd3) and see the difference. This Agadmator is unable to do as he is simply a slave to some engine line. 

Still we have to read all about how awesome this guy is and how everybody is adding to their ""vast knowledge"". I think on the other hand chess coaches around the world will have plenty of work for years to come to correct all the chess misunderstandings people have ""learned"" while increasing their ""vast knowledge"".",1609730845

1773,What do you think is the comparative strength of users on various chess servers?,chess,"I've played on chess.com, FICS, and more recently set up an account at lichess.org. I found the ratings on lichess to be really over-inflated compared to the other two (though I've only played a few games), and FICS on the other hand definitely seems to have the most suppressed ELO ratings compared to actual level of play of them all.

Looking to put together a regression for my stats class at Uni comparing ratings across systems (FIDE/USCF/Chess.com/Lichess). If you could fill out **this** [**quick form**](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAN__gNROvJUNUo0WVhUUEQ0WVY4WDdTNTJIQU1TRDc3WS4u) I would much appreciate it (please leave question blank if no established rating). 

If you're curious about what already exists on the topic ChessGoals did something similar in November, the results are published [here](https://chessgoals.com/rating-comparison/). I'll be sure to follow up here with my own findings as well.

I read the rules, pretty sure this post is okay, if not remember that it's the thought that counts.

Isn't PGN a standard format? I understand that each site/app can have their own custom annotations like drawings on boards, timestamps, etc. But those shouldn't break the basic syntax, right?

If I remove the ""∓"" sign, Lichess can import the PGN without issues.  I wonder which site has a wrong PGN implementation here: is it okay to use more complicated glyphs other than ""?"" or ""!"" directly on moves, or do they have to be part of the comment?",1609707883

I would only want to express the shame that it is for Candidates 2020 organisation to see such a strong player out of the CT 2020. He got his opportunity after winning a tournament (Chess World Cup 2019), different from other competitors that joined it as ""wildcards"". And he refused to participate because of a pandemic, which turned out to be a serious event and stopped the tournament in the middle. It was so serious that the CT2020 wasn't even finished. He's paying the price for being more reasonable than the other participants and the own organisation. I say other participants, because I don't think that Caruana or Ding would be treated the same way by the organisation. 

By the good performances we've been watching, especially the last one, and also by the performance of MVL (the competitor chosen to play in the place of Radja) in the beginning of the CT2020 (1st position), it is safe to say that the results would be completely different if he was in.

1825,"Opinions on engines and the ""magic"" of chess?",chess,"I was watching several analysis videos of Kasparov-Topalov recently, and found the game extremely captivating. So I decide to check the game a bit myself, and turn on stockfish. Turns out that Kasparov's 28. Qc3 is actually a blunder (checking at depth 43), and he didn't find the objective perfect way to play. It kind of ruined the idea of an ""immortal game"" for me. Of course, it's still a brilliant game with several incredible moves, but there's also a part of me that wishes the game was correctly played by Kasparov all the way.

On the other hand, engines can find lines that we never would have found otherwise, such as Carlsen-Caruana game 6. In this case, I remember spending hours looking through lines and still barely comprehending that there was a win.

So what do yall think? Does engine analysis ruin the ""magic"" of past games? Do engines make chess more or less interesting?",1609699777

1846,Ruy Lopez Move Order,chess,"I was studying the mainline Ruy Lopez and I was wondering why black often plays d6 prior to castling. 

I understand that castling first provides black with the opportunity to play the Marshall Attack afterwards. However, I can't see the downside of castling first even if black plans on playing d6 on the next move. 

Most of the time, it seems like the position will transpose into the standard closed Ruy Lopez mainline. However, white may sometimes choose to play an anti-marshall move like a4 or h3. If black was to then play d6, wouldn't white wish that he had played the standard move, c3?

I wake up this morning, and discover a message from chess.com saying that I’ve been awarded 73 points back on my rating they “ detected that one or more of your recent opponents has violated our Fair Play Policy”

So three out of the four people I played yesterday were cheaters. 

I’m guessing the way to play chess online is only with people you know and trust, but christ, it’s just so disheartening when it puts you in a place where you feel like an egomaniac because you’re doubting someone’s skill purely on the basis that they’re beating you. You tell yourself to stop being so arrogant, and then 24 hours later, you’re proved right.

For some time now I have wanted to stream me learning Najdorf and just to give it some context.

I have a fide rating of 2163 and have been a chess educator for over 10 years. 

I have played the Najdorf for 8 years, I have studied a few lines and gone through chessables ""Najdorf simplified"", but forgot a lot of lines since I didn't know how important the reviewing of lines afterwards.  So overall while I have many games in the opening in all time controls I have never felt that I understood the positions. I have bought Giri's course on the najdorf and planning to base the stream on that course.

2. How would you like the streams to be structured?

I recently started playing on chess.com against the bots and I’m wondering how their rating compares to the ELO of a real player?

I just played Nelson and while I don’t really know how to take advantage of his queen action strategically, I am able to beat him if I don’t make any blunders (He usually gets ahead in the count by some pawns but then loses his rook on obvious attacks.) 
Considering I do make blunders sometimes I would say that I am able to beat him 6.5/10 both black and white.

I haven’t played in ages but as a kid I played at about a 1250 DWZ (German Rating) Niveau which corresponds to about 1300 ELO I think. 

Considering the above, I can’t really believe that I’m playing at a real 1300 even though I don’t really calculate moves ahead as I would playing a tournament or any rated game.

I play on Mobile (iPhone 11) if that makes any difference in computing.

1944,How do you truly improve?,chess,"Heads up - this will be a somewhat long post.

I am currently a ~1100 rated player and I am experiencing something strange. The more I learn about chess, the more I lose and the worse I play.

So far my approach has been - 2-4h of daily practice which consists of:
- studying tactics (chesstactics.org - the book Predators at Chessboard)
- 20-30 puzzles
- a few online games which I analyze using engine and write down all of my mistakes (undefended pieces, bad trades, blunders, etc.)
- 10-20 games vs bots on chess.com (difficulties 1000-1600)

The rest of the time I watch John Bartolomew's guides, GothamChess on openings and agadmator's analysis of games of super GMs.

I went from 600 to 1100 in less than a month doing this. However, the past few weeks, I have been constantly declining in rating and losing 80% games no matter what (even though I understand the game much better). Two weeks ago I was beating almost everyone at the same rating of around 1100. This seems impossible now.

So I started playing chess in December and I was not good at all, I started to fall in love with the game after a few weeks of playing. After a long losing streak I decided I wanted to learn the game more and do some research, so I hit the books. I bought some books, did some reading, and watch videos on YouTube and I built a solid foundation for myself. Today I was playing and I FINALLY did a successful fried liver attack and I’m so excited. The reason I’m so pumped up is because this is the first time I was able to recognize a situation and jump on the attack, I forked the black rook and queen with a bishop covering my knight then I proceeded to take blacks queen and the player resigned. After that I threw my hands up in the air and was so happy, but then I went onto a 2 game losing streak LOL. Anyway I just wanted to share this experience with you all, thank you for reading!",1609617839
1993,Looking for help with analysing these games. (~1600 lichess),chess,"I am currently around 1600 level on lichess, and I usually try to analyse all my games fairly thoroughly after playing them. I've gone on a bit of a losing streak over the past few games (though a couple were just undefended-piece blunders or low-on-time blunders) but when analysing them I spotted a couple of common ideas that are the cause of many of my losses. I've made an effort to think about exactly what happened here, but there are a few things I don't fully understand and I'd appreciate some help.

[Game 1](https://lichess.org/RLwOdjqt/black) \- How could I have converted the advantage earlier?

The most ""direct"" reason why I lost this was simply running low on time, blundering away my material advantage and making one incorrect king move that turned it from a draw to a loss. 

But was there a fairly straightforward *general plan* that I could have followed (once the endgame began) that could have helped me convert the advantage earlier, before running low on time? The only noticeable thing seems to be the forced mate in 5 at move 27 but for someone at my level that didn't seem very easy to spot during the game. As soon as the endgame began, the opponent started going after my pawns which meant I had to spend turns trying to defend them and didn't really have a coherent plan for most of the endgame.

[Game 2](https://lichess.org/BHUkBonT) \- How do you defend against these sorts of pawn-pushing kingside attacks?

I don't know why I didn't take their g-pawn in the opening (and this entire situation could possibly have been avoided if I had) but I tend to lose lots of games to attacks where the opponent delays castling, pushes a pawn on the kingside, puts a rook behind it and possibly starts bringing minor pieces like bishops in as well. Most of the time when this kind of thing happens, I end up having my kingside blown open and lose quite badly. I'd like some help in understanding exactly why moves like 15. h3 (and 17. hxg4) are bad (I was trying to get rid of the pawn before it got to the third rank). The best moves  as given by the engine seem a bit non-obvious. 

In this game, was the reason I didn't deal well with this attack because of a positional problem where the light-squared bishop and the knight weren't really doing anything, or was it just moves 15 and 17 that were too weakening? Are there general strategies for dealing with attacks like this, possibly trying to punish the opponent for not castling early (although they could easily just castle queenside straight away?) Were there specific moves in this game that were particularly bad?

Any help with analysing these games and these ideas in particular would be much appreciated, thanks!",1609617753

Through the list, ordered by date of award and then federation, one can get an ideas about which federations are ""GM producers"" (or importers), at least in the recent years.

A GM producer/importer is a federation with at least 5 GMs in the last 5 years (2016-2020) and no more than 1 year without GMs in the last 5 years.

  * Cuba (I know that Cuba has quite a chess history, but I didn't know it was still so regular producing GMs!)
  * France
  * Germany
  * Hungary
  * India (impressive, Anand being the first of all of the GMs that play for India, getting GM in 1988 and still being the first by rating among them. This is an incredible achievement)
  * Iran (booming also very recently)

For many here, this is not much of an accomplishment. But for me, chess is mostly a way to relax. I don't study openings and I mostly play in the morning or when I'm winding down for the day.

2059,Complete Lichess study for How to Reassess your Chess,chess,"Hi everyone!

I know, this has been posted and tried a few times before, but I'd like to create Lichess studies for all games and examples in the book ""How to Reassess your Chess - 4th edition"". I think it's just much more convenient to follow along in a study than to transcribe all moves by hand or follow along with a board.

I have made contact with someone who started this project via this subreddit a few years back and we have combined our efforts to complete the whole book. The current state of affairs is that we have completed 54% of all diagrams. I believe that with a little help of some volunteers we could get this to 100% in a short amount of time.

If someone is interested to help I'd submit each person a list of diagrams / games that need to be transcribed (I'm thinking 10-20; depending on the number of volunteers) and after receiving the PGNs grant access to the complete study.

To maintain intellectual property you'd have to proof that you actually own the book before you can participate.

If you're interested in helping please reply here or send me a DM.",1609594434

2067,Best way to improve?,chess,"Hi guys,
I have learned to play chess as a child but have never seriously played it. I know the rules and maybe some basic concepts but nothing more than that. Like many after watching the queens gambit I wanted to try it again - also because my kids (4 and 7) have both developed an interest in chess. 

Right now I am pretty bad - I have started to play on chess.com and so far am something like 1-9 or so. I am simply doing too many mistakes because I fail to see something or walk blindly into traps. I would like to get better but am not sure, what the best use of my time is. I don’t have much time. Should I just play a lot of games and get better this way, should I do puzzles? The tutorials? Watch some YouTube (which series? Preferably not just single videos but a playlist that builds on the other videos)? Read a book?

**Disclaimer (1):** I know it's a very unusual content for this sub to say the least. I'll totally understand if it's not appropriate. But you can view this post as education about some thoughts and sayings of the World Champions.

**Disclaimer (2):** it's a highly speculative idea and I'm just your average uneducated Joe (not a linguist). May be total garbage... but it's very important for me anyway, it's not some deliberate joke.

I also intended this post to be much more diverse, not only about the Champs, but I rushed to get this post done in/after the New Year

Happy New Year!)

I think every person has a simple abstract speaking pattern
 
you can formulate those patterns with the help of a few concepts that I hope will be intuitive enough (so let's play it out!))

I will quote *Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov, Robert Fischer, Wilhelm Steinitz* **+** *Mikhail Tal, Vladimir Kramnik, Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand*

***
 
*(General description of the idea)*
 
A spoken message has 2 levels. The *""flow""* of information (how it comes) and the *""shape""* of what this information describes. It's like a river: when you're close you see the *flow*, when you're far away you see the *shape* of the flow.
 
To describe a single level you need 2 concepts, 2 (mutually exclusive?) alternatives. Why? I don't know (not sure).
 
Maybe because any spoken message has 2 ""modes"", ""more connected"" and ""less connected"". For example:

[""There are times when we question the things we know (a) We never thought that the cracks would begin to show (b)""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJI6LkRU4KE)

You can assume that (a) follows from (b) (""*BUT* we never thought..."") **or** that (a) and (b) just state the matter of fact and both follow from something else. Depending on the interpretation you can view (b) as e.g. a condition or a context.

Simply speaking, the idea is to make some concepts you can apply to speech **and then** to apply it to different basic ""levels"" and ""interpretations"" of a spoken message **and so** you get a description of a ""speech pattern"". Please tell me if that idea about ""levels"" is intuitive enough!

***

So let's try to play a game with concepts like this!):

**on low level** [Boris Spassky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Spassky) tells logically/truly connected or equivalent (=) bits or jumps (-) from a thing to a thing
 
*on high level* Spassky describes an event embedded (&gt;&gt;) in a larger context or conjugated factors (,,)

A simple example of (-) is ""He's with us. He helped me"": it's not incoherent in the context, but there's no obvious connection. (-) is a wild card, it means no connection or any connection.

A simple example of (=) is ""You can't beat me! I am the champion of the galaxy, I am the best!"": it describes truly/logically connected or sort of equivalent things or a very strong condition.

A simple example of (&gt;&gt;) is ""This work is so hard! I got so tired of it!"": an event (""I got tired"") is embedded in the wider context of the hard work.
 
A simple example of (,,) is ""I’m chasing my dream. But the more I try, the farther away it gets"": in this example the situation is defined by a condition of 2 connected and clear factors...
 
- *In my country, at that time, being a champion of chess was like being a King.* (-)(=) *At that time I was a King - and when you are King you feel a lot of responsibility, but there is nobody there to help you.*
 
- *When I played Bobby Fischer, my opponent fought against organizations - the television producers and the match organizers.* (-)(=) *But he never fought against me personally.* (-)(=) *I lost to Bobby before the match because he was already stronger than I. He won normally.*
 
**on low level** Spassky deals with conditions of an accidental situation, *on high level* Spassky sees the global context and the key ""strategic"" factors there



**on low level** [Anatoly Karpov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoly_Karpov) jumps (-) from a thing to a thing or tells logically/truly connected or equivalent (=) bits
 
*on high level* Karpov describes the landscape of the situation (==) or their speech doesn't add up (--) to anything in particular

(-) is a wild card, it means no connection or any connection.

(=) describes truly connected/sort of equivalent things or a very strong condition.

A simple example of (==) is ""We run out of ammo and are very tired. Our morale is low. Enemies are surrounding us and it's getting dark..."". In this example you see a description of different details of the overall situation (and this is what I call ""the landscape of the situation"").

A simple example of (--) is ""Salad is good! I ate some salad today."": what do BOTH sentences describe together? a particular situation? a particular fact? Nothing in particular. Just some coincidental circumstances...
 
- *After that, Kasparov stepped back from chess which is, and I want this to be clear, not good for chess in general at all.* (-)(=) *As a whole, the current situation in the chess world leaves a lot to be desired.*
 
- *If the opponent offers keen play I don't object;* (-)(=) *but in such cases I get less satisfaction, even if I win, than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic.*

**(on low level)** Karpov jumps (-) from a thing to a thing or tells truly connected (=) or equivalent bits, *(on high level)* Karpov describes details of the situation with Kasparov and etc. or their speech doesn't add up to anything in particular
 
**on low level** Karpov deals with conditions of an accidental situation, *on high level* Karpov sees the global situation and ""coincedences"" or ""incidents"" there


**on low level** [Bobby Fischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer) jumps (-) from a thing to a thing or expands (&gt;) information
 
*on high level* Bobby Fischer describes conjugated factors (,,) or coincidental circumstances (--) i.e. their speech doesn't add up to anything in particular

A simple example of (&gt;) is ""I was going to the bookstore. I was counting flowers on the way"": in this example you just expand on the thing (topic) you already said.

(,,) describes 2 or more connected factors that define a situation
 
- *I'm not afraid of Spassky.* (-)(&gt;) *The world knows I'm the best.* (-)(&gt;) *You don't need a match to prove it.*
 
- *He’s a good player.* (-)(&gt;) *He knows the openings better now than in his more brilliant period, but his game is less strong.* (-)(&gt;) *Maybe he has some complex with me.* [about Reshevsky]

**(on low level)** Fischer goes (-) from a thing to a thing or expands (&gt;) on the thing they already said, *(on high level)* Fischer gives 2 or more factors defining the situation
 
**on low level** Fischer deals with yearnings of an accidental ongoing situation, *on high level* Fischer deals with strategic factors and ""coincidences"" in the world or life (those quotes barely show this, sorry)


**on low level** [Wilhelm Steinitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz) jumps (-) from a topic to a topic or adds (+) on (versions of) topics
 
*on high level* Steinitz describes ""the landscape of the situation"" (==) or tells (most important) standalone facts (.)

А simple example of (+) is ""I love ice cream! What a good day to love ice cream! It's so good to be able to love something!"": in this example you just keep piling up new topics or new versions of the same topic on and on.

(.) is a bunch of standalone facts/events that don't need any context to be understood, every bit of (.)-speech is a self-sustained point... you can split such speech into pieces without losing any context...

- *I am fully and entirely concentrated on the board.* (-)(+) *I never even consider my opponent's personality.* (-)(+) *So far as I am concerned, my opponent might as well be an abstraction or an automaton.*
 
- *I would rather die in America than live in England.* (-)(+) *I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England.* (-)(+) *I have come to the conclusion that I neither mean to die soon or to lose the match!*

**(on low level)** Steinitz jumps from a thing to a thing or adds on topics/versions of the same topic, *(on high level)* Steinitz describes details of the situation with the match and concentration

**on low level** Steinitz deals with an accidental piling up situation, *on high level* Steinitz sees the most important fact or event in the current world's or life's situation
 

***

**on low level** [Mikhail Tal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Tal) talks about conjugated (,) circumstances or jumps (-) from a thing to a thing 
 
*on high level* Tal describes ""the landscape of the situation"" (==) or coincidental circumstances (--) i.e. their speech doesn't add up to anything in particular

A simple example of (,) is ""I'm running to the beach. People are playing at the beach"": in this example two not very related pieces of information are united by common circumstances (by the place - the beach), so we are sort of getting two perspectives on the same topic or two sides of the same coin...

(==) describes different details of the same overall situation...

- *It's funny, but many people don't understand why I draw so many games nowadays.* (,)(-) *They think my style must have changed but this is not the case at all.* (,)(-) *The answer to this drawing disease is that my favorite squares are e6, f7, g7 and h7 and everyone now knows this.* (,)(-) *They protect these squares not once but four times!*

- *Later, I began to succeed in decisive games.* (,)(-) *Perhaps because I realized a very simple truth: not only was I worried, but also my opponent*

**on low level** Tal deals with accidental simultaneous circumstances of the specific ongoing situation, *on high level* Tal observes the global world's or life's situation and ""coincidences"" or ""incidents"" there



I'm not sure about Vladimir Kramnik, but we can I can try this description:

**on low level** [Vladimir Kramnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Kramnik) talks about conjugated (,) circumstances or jumps (-) from a thing to a thing 

*on high level* Kramnik describes ""the landscape of the situation"" (==) or quickly characterizes the situation (++) 

A simple example of (++) is ""I'm lost in the forest and don't know what to do!"": this quickly characterizes the situation or describes a fact that causes continuous implications (a problem that needs to be solved).

(++) describes something that continuously causes things to happen (benefits/troubles or else), for example a big problem that needs to be solved or a gift that keeps of giving...

- *I didn't think about it during the match, but I realized it rather quickly after the victory.* (,)(-) *I don't think it was me who changed much. It was instead a turnaround of life circumstances.* (,)(-) *Those were turbulent years when the world championship cycle was virtually nonexistent.*

- *In chess one cannot control everything.* (,)(-) *Sometimes a game takes an unexpected turn, in which beauty begins to emerge.* (,)(-) *Both players are always instrumental in this.*

**on low level** Kramnik deals with accidental simultaneous circumstances of the specific ongoing situation, *on high level* Kramnik observes the main source of troubles or benefits in the global world's or life's situation [(see also the quote about Berlin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Defence_(chess)#History)


**on low level** [Garry Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov) adds on (+) topics or tells logically/truly connected or equivalent (=) bits

*on high level* Garry Kasparov quickly characterizes the situation (++) or tells standalone facts (.)

A simple example of (=) is ""I can't lose! If I lose, I won't be able to help my friends!"": it describes truly/logically connected or sort of equivalent things or a very strong condition.

A simple example of (.) is ""I'm a big boss in a big town. I live a big life. I own huge money"": in this example you can split the speech into pieces (like ""I live a big life"") without losing any context...

- *Nowadays games immediately appear on the Internet and thus the life of novelties is measured in hours.* (+)(=) *Modern professionals do not have the right to be forgetful – it is ‘life threatening’.*

- *By the time a player becomes a Grandmaster, almost all of his training time is dedicated to work on this first phase.* (+)(=) *The opening is the only phase that holds out the potential for true creativity and doing something entirely new.*

**on low level (information):** there's two ways to slice it -- Kasparov either adds on topics/versions of the same topic (about opening) or alternatively tells strongly connected bits i.e. equivalent bits i.e. conditions

*on high level (situation):* Kasparov either describes continuous implications of becoming a GM/existence of Opening or alternatively just gives a bunch of standalone facts

**on low level** Kasparov deals with piling up conditions of an accidental situation, *on high level* Kasparov observes the main source of troubles or benefits in the world


**on low level** [Viswanathan Anand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand) tells logically/truly connected or equivalent (=) bits or talks about conjugated (,) circumstances

*on high level* Anand describes an event embedded (&gt;&gt;) in a larger context or quickly characterizes the situation (++)

A simple example of (&gt;&gt;) is ""This play was so beautiful! The theater is always amazing!"": an event/thing (""play"") is embedded in the wider context of the theater.

(++) describes something that continuously causes things to happen (benefits/troubles or else), for example a big problem that needs to be solved or a gift that keeps of giving...

- *Parents, first and foremost, it is important to... understand and recognise the activities your child is naturally gravitating towards.* (,)(=) *It's important also to ensure that your child likes what he or she is doing.* (,)(=) *I believe in exposing children to as many hobbies and extracurricular activities as possible.*

- *Before a game, I avoid having a heavy meal so that I don't feel sleepy at the board.* (,)(=) *You eat to be healthy, and that generally takes care of everything.* (,)(=) *Also, you can't be too finicky, since at tournaments you tend to eat at restaurants here and there.* (,)(=) *But, as long as you're eating sensibly, it's all good.*

**on low level** Anand deals with conditions of simultaneous things, *on high level* Anand describes the source of troubles or benefits in a global context

***

I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a person focuses on.

You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each character tells you something about some layer of the situation.

You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns in a single global ""spectrum"":

- *Robert Fischer &lt; Mikhail Tal &lt; Anatoly Karpov* **(in the middle)** *&lt; Vladimir Kramnik &lt; Boris Spassky &lt; Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand &lt; Wilhelm Steinitz*

The farther you go, the more a person focuses on a single fact...  or the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets.

For example, **Robert Fischer** may deal with ""coincidences"" and ""dependence"" on some global factors, **Anatoly Karpov** deals with things on 1-1 scale operating by conditions of the present time, **Boris Spassky** looks at things from some global context and **Wilhelm Steinitz** tries to find self-contained truths

**Kramnik** deals with implications of simultaneous things in temporal current situations — **Kasparov** deals with self-defining implications and etc. ...

***
 
**P.S.**
 
If those patterns apply to **real people** &amp; music bands they are very important,
 
I want to attract attention to those patterns and eventually check if they are **real** or not.

2104,Which opening would you advice for a 1600 lichess rapid player ?,chess,"After around 800 games, I reached 1600 at lichess rapid. It's not fantastic progress but not too bad knowing that I am learning as an adult (I am 33 yo). I started one year ago.

I have not learned any theory so far. I only train tactics (1800 at [chess.com](https://chess.com/) tactics). As white, I always play E4, then F3, and bishop C4/C3, then I castle.  I adjust it a bit depending on what my opponent does but getting my kingside minor pieces out of the garage as fast as possible and castling is my main goal.

I would like to add a bit of novelty and learn one opening. Would you have one to advise me?

My goal for 2021 is to reach 1800 at lichess rapid. To reach this goal, I will keep on training tactics and I will maybe learn theory a bit.

2121,Why is it so much easier for me to find the best moves as a spectator than while playing myself,chess,"Maybe some of you can relate with this and even provide an explanation towards why it is like this. 

This is actually a question that has lingered in my mind for a bit, but today it became very apparent. I am watching Daniel Naroditsky play and noticed that a lot of times i instinctively gravitate towards the same moves he will play.

Of course he’s a very instructive player and explains his thought process a lot, but the same thing happens then. It’s like when i watch him, we’re on the page most of the times. And this happens with him, the chessbrahs, basically anyone i watch. Same goes when analysing games or watching analysis by guys like agadmator or the Saint louis chess lectures. 


I simply see much stronger moves much more often than when i play my own games. I am hovering around the 1870-1950 rating range in both rapid and bullet on lichess and play rather confidently at an estimated FIDE rating of 1600 in longer games (according to my coach). 

However the moves i see when i spectate chess are simply better. I mean when you watch chess being played you kind of play the game too, trying to look for the best moves and estimating the position. I mean that’s what makes spectating chess fun in the first place. 
But while i “play” along these GM games, it seems like i make a lot less blunders and play better moves. It seems like my positional understanding is a lot better when i spectate chess. 

Does anyone relate to this or is it a placebo kind of effect even?

I recently played as white and won [this rapid game.](https://www.chess.com/analysis/game/live/6110486202) (please let me know if the link doesn't work).

I have a question about key moments. There are times when the engine flags a mistake, and upon looking at the suggested ""best move"", it doesn't seem to be a great move?  
  
For example, on move 14, when I played Bxc7, the engine suggests I play Bxd7+, however the King can take on the next move.  
  
How deep does the engine look when suggesting alternate moves on Key Moments?

It works probably around 1/3 of the time for me at 1200 rating on chess.com. The ideal line for black is 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nd4 4. Nxe5 Qg5 5. Nxf7 Qxg2 6. Rf1 Qxe4+ 7. Be2 Nf3#. 

What confuses me is that, while 7.Be2 is marked as a blunder by the engine, I'd expect it to be analyzed as giving black mate in 1, but instead it just gives it a score of -318. The engine does usually give very large scores of around 60 when the king is very unsafe but there's not quite a forced mate, but I've never seen 318, and I don't see why it would assign a number when mate in 1 is available.",1609458899

Where it is white's turn to move. When white moved, I was caught off guard and subsequently lost the puzzle because the queen took the rook on a7. My question is why does the queen make this move? In my mind, the queen is pinned only to the knight - the lower value piece, so I expected the queen to move away and for me to just be allowed to take the knight with my rook. However, both [chess.com](https://chess.com) and [nextchessmove.com](https://nextchessmove.com) confirmed that the queen takes on a7. What have I missed?",1609449646

I am going over a recent game I played and I am confused on the suggestion that Stockfish gives for the best move. It is black to move:

&amp;#x200B;

[Black to move.](https://preview.redd.it/7jt9o91p6l861.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b400be79eaf0794d8b14d4c6408dd81aadbea0b9)

Stockfish is saying that I should have done Ke7. But this seems like a bad move to me. My knight is currently protecting my pawn on e5. If I move Ke7, wouldn't white just do Kxe5? Seems like I am just going to give him a free pawn.  Instead, I played a6 in order to attack the bishop. 

Also, when I do Ke7, stockfish then suggestions that white castles kingside. Once again, this seems odd to me, since white seems to be passing up on a free pawn.

I designed, built, and deployed the app in only a couple days so the its pretty simplistic, but I hope it can work at least as a basic move logger.

It's currently only available on iOS but android should be ready soon.

Thank you in advance!",1609443260

So over the last few days I’ve been loosing lots of games to the same strategy over and over again. Sorry in advance for my terrible notation but it goes something like this:

1.e4 1.e5 / 2.Qh5 2.G6 / 3.Qxe5 3.Be2 / 4.Qxh8 ...

I don’t know how to stop the queen taking my pawn and then rook. I’ve seen variations which goes 3.Qf3 which I can counter with 3.nf6 to keep pressure off of the f7 pawn.

Another tactic I’ve seen is 3. Be2 3.bxa4(the pawn, not the bishop) / 4. Bxa4(bishop takes pawn)#

My favorite chess book that I've read is by far ""Sillman's complete endgame course"" because it takes the approach of recommending learning certain crucial endgames for each rating range. Additionally, [chess.com](https://chess.com)'s custom tactics tool is great for personalized tactics training. 

Where I think the biggest niche for this personalization is in openings, middlegames, and positional play.

I've decided to start a twitch series in which I'll be coding a chess engine from scratch. While I'm confident I can get something going on, I imagine it'd be at best a 1200 rated tactical beast with no understanding of the game.

So I've convinced myself that by far the hardest thing to do, as in real chess, is to evaluate positions. My initial approach is just going to be the mathematical, materialistic approach where the side with more material is better. I'm sure we can all come up with positions where this doesn't work, so my question to all of you guys is:

If you were to teach our future computer overlords how to evaluate a position, how would you do it?

Here are some of my ideas
* Check for activity (checks, captures, threats... Who has more?)
* Check for piece position (you may be up a knight, but if the knight is stuck in the corner, you may as well not have it)
* The trickiest for me: check for pawn structure

Timebank = You get x seconds to move and if that's not enough, then you eat into your timer; but if it is, then your timer is not increased by the remainder.

The former is very frequent while the latter is nonexistent afaik.

I guess you want to reward players for playing faster than their normal turn time, but the fact that increments over-reward(?) playing ""to book"" (e.g. learn one opening book and play that quickly) and premove-shenanigans (although they are really cool and actually come with their own meta) that remove the game further from it's original idea make this not worth.

They have plenty of videos about different openings, but I just feel very good playing e4 every game as white and e5 as black to see if I can do that Gambit (the Knight f6 Queen e7 one, I feel like it's really good VS Queen pawn because chances are, at this elo (800) they will play London a lot).

When you started playing chess, did you study a bunch of openings or did you stick to one?

Of course I have learned different options like Kings Indian, London, Queens Gambit, Scandinavian, Danish Gambit, Slav... But I feel like e4 is so easy to play that if I play anything else I'm gonna miss a lot of things (specially the Kings Indian, I don't know why but it's so hard to play to me)

Also: Do you have any recommendation that you remember worked very well in low elo?

On one side there is the ruling party who has been in control for almost 20 years, on the other side there is a new group supported by all Brazilian major players from the present and the past, including the Top 3 players of the Brazilian Rating ranking (GM Leitão, GM Supi, GM Krikor). 

The major complaint against the ruling party is that they are persecuting and repressing players who do not support their administration. Apparently, they are not allowing players to participate in big tournaments and refuse to promote or recognize players who do not agree with them. 

The first time I heard this I thought it was just some kind of election Trash-Talking, but two days ago ex-Brazilian champion IM Roberto Molina [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flgFLk_je8Q) exposing many emails he changed with CBX official communication channel just before the 2018 Brazilian national championship. 

In the emails, the CBX: 

* Showed lots of disrespect and even insulted him. 

* Created new rules that were not in the regulations of the tournament solely to not allow him to participate. 

* Tried to intimidate him by implying he was a criminal and asking for information about his job that absolutely was not related to the tournament. 

IM Molina got first place in the regional classification event but CBX simply removed his name from the list of classified players. His participation was only confirmed just some days before the event because he had to move a lawsuit against the confederation.

Ironically he won the whole thing and was declared the 2018 Brazilian Champion, but now CBX treats him like a pariah. 

Many Brazilian top players are telling they experienced similar situations. I write this in hope that it can reach someone from FIDE, maybe they can conduct an investigation and do something against CBX.",1609404946

* The top 8 players advance to a six-day knockout, with two days each for the quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. 

The time controls used in the Champions Chess Tour will be the same as for the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour:

* Rapid: 15'+10"" (each player has 15 minutes for all moves, with a 10-second increment after each move)

* Blitz: 5'+3""

* Armageddon: White has 5 minutes to Black’s 4, with no increments. If the game is drawn, Black wins the match.

A total of 100 Tour points are at stake in the Airthings Masters (20 for finishing 1st in the preliminary rounds, and 80 for winning the final). Tour points are important since the top 8 players on the Tour will automatically be invited to the next tournament.

I have previously discussed with other Redditors about a possible course on the Sicillian Grand Prix since I have played this throughout my life and with the help of latest Engines and hardware, I think I am very good for the opening (I am a 2550 Lichess Rated Player, 2150+ FIDE)

I have prepared the database and was going to release the Video Course but sadly, a moment before I went to start recording I checked Chessable Author FAQ and found out they take 60% out of every sale and give authors just 40%.

I am unsure whether going through Chessable is the best solution or if I should just host a seminar/workshop and share these files there? If such a thing happens, will anyone be willing to discuss these openings? I charge less around $15/hour (less, but I am from a third world country) and so comparatively - It will be much easier for me to make money through personal coaching than Chessable.

What do you all think? Is going ahead and publishing course (20 hours of video approximately) makes sense? Please let me know what you all think.

As a fun little project I created a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cman6397/chess_history/blob/master/Chess%20History.ipynb) to get all the games I have played on chess(dot)com over all my different usernames and graphed the moving average of my rating. 

I was inspired by  [Greg Shahade's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLZ2l_ilFxQ) where he showed that he uses a moving average to evaluate his current rating instead of his current static rating.  He also uses a performance rating instead of the chess(dot)com rating but I did not implement that (Let me know if you would like me too).  

 You can plug in your usernames, a start/end year, and a moving average window to make your own graph! I had a total of 52,000 games which is pretty incredible.  If you are like me and have lots of accounts this is pretty much the only way to see your complete progress.",1609366927

Seriously if this makes me a top 10% player, just how bad is the average chess player? I consider myself a terrible player, I will never play in a tournament because I am ashamed at how bad I am... What metric is lichess using here?

Is it by account creation? For example I am better than 90% of players who created an account the same time as me? (because this account is only 2 weeks old). What about the millions of players who're rated 2000+ in blitz but don't play rapid and thus have the base line 1500 rating?

I am sure many people have just about had it with this low effort, clickbait, gimmick channel drowning out much better content creators.

The latest video he shows a game between Dubov and Carlsen, I wanted to see if things had improved but I already gave up about 3-4 minutes in after this....

1:57 ""a4 by Dubov is a new move so already we have a completely new game."" 

ok, fine it seems he knows how to use a lookup function in Chessbase but that seems to be the minumum effort, brief look at computer moves and off we go.

Then he shows a cool computer line with Bxb4 in a hypothetical line....cool move but he makes no effort to explain the move and clearly doesn't understand at all why Bxb4 is a good move. So why show it in the first place? He only sees a cool move suggested by the computer, then shows it but makes zero effort to understand any of it nor explain it. I had to check myself so makes me wonder why people bother and don't watch people that either a) understand or b) make an effort to.

After showing the line (which is after the novelty pawn to a4) he says that ""...so black always avoid this"" .....ok barely a minute ago he says that a4 was a novelty and then he blurts out that people avoid this in a position that has never been played before??? This is typical pretentious BS that he always does, pretending to know something he doesn't and coming across as some authority.

My question is, why do people keep worshipping everything this guy puts forward and nobody is ever critical? Do people just love these silly memes sentences and don't care about the chess?

2379,Puzzle/tactics books before 1960? (and tribute to puzzle rush survival),chess,"It is awesome that nowadays there are tools like puzzle rush survival (see n1). I mean in the past some promising players maybe struggled for resources to keep training that weren't that expensive. 

Nowadays there are plenty of those quite well organized (although surely there is still room for improvement). Having a challenge that automatically proposes puzzles of increasing difficulty and one has quite some time to study them is just great. I know that such tactics aren't all in a chess game, but still it is a great resource.

How way the situation before 1960? **Were there specialized publications with tactics?** Surely there were enough books, but I was interested in tactics books. Something like the 5334 problems by the father of the Polgar sisters. 

For sure one could analyse the game and use them as ""tactics trainer"", simply picking a random move after the opening and checking if any tactics was there, but that was quite some work.

Hence my question, whether there were specialized books (or periodicals) with collection of tactics.

On the side: it is also nice to see players doing puzzle rush survival in one seat and somehow explaining their approach (not everyone does it).

Actually if chess.com would organize a competition with strong players making videos solving as much as they could in one seat (with cameras everywhere) would be also very interesting (much better than the puzzle rush battle in my opinion, that is like bullet). Then they could commentate and explain how one could approach the problems.

What's different about Chess Puzzle Blitz is it's a timed puzzle solving match (1 on 1) and you can play for fun or for cash (We use [Skillz](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200902005370/en/Skillz-Set-Public-Bring-Competitive-Mobile-Gaming) to power that experience.

Naturally, the predictable story, ""I saw Queen's Gambit and..."" yep, it inspired me to return to the game.

I am planning to do some reading too, which I understand is really very important for anyone looking to make chess a regular hobby.

I do have some questions I've been mulling around in my head, and thought I'd take a chance asking them here. I know this forum is supersaturated with highly proficient chess players. I apologize if my question is ""woefully naive,"" but nevertheless--chance taken.

QUESTION: Can there be a ""no mistakes"" game? 

The premise being that each player makes an optimal best move all throughout... and that in the end, what determined the winner was simply the serendipity of the first few moves. Is that a true statement? Or, if not, does it mean that yes--in the final analysis ONE player makes what is considered the WRONG move that then seals their fate in ultimately losing the game?",1609346151

2427,Is castling early really that important?,chess,"I'm rated around 1500-1600 on lichess. I've been losing lots of games recently to opponents who follow this particular general plan in the opening to early middlegame:

* We both move a few pawns and develop some minor pieces (as usual in openings)
* I usually castle kingside at this point, they don't castle
* They start pushing a g-pawn or h-pawn down the board and put a rook behind it
* They bring minor piece(s) towards my side of the board
* At move 20+ they might eventually castle queenside

By this point they're usually threatening to rip open my kingside literally just with the pawn with a rook behind it, and sometime start bringing in minor pieces as well. Capturing the pawn with an f/g/h pawn just tends to leave my king wide open and then within a few moves, the attack becomes crushing.

I've read before that if the opponent leaves their king in the center for a long time then you're supposed to try and open the center and attack as quickly as possible, but at this point in the game there are still lots of pawns and minor pieces in the way so it almost seems as though castling makes your king easier rather than harder to attack.

What are the best ways to avoid losing quickly when your opponent does something like this? Is castling early really that important if you can just start pushing pawns towards your opponent and having your king in the center isn't that vulnerable with all the pieces in the way?",1609340231

I'm about to buy a few courses on chessable (recommend any paid courses if you'd like), but I figured it would be best to order the courses based on a system of priority. Which brings me here.

One thing that's very important to me is not learning bad impulsive habits, I want to learn to systematically approach the situation on the board (or tactics/endgame puzzle) in the most efficient way possible rather than ""just do it"" in a sloppy/disorganized fashion that leads to missed superior opportunities or blunders.

I suppose I'll just list everything I can think of and hope someone can prioritize them or offer something better?

E.g, beginner (&lt;1500 ELO), intermediate (1500-1700), etc. A chess teacher will know a lot from experience, but one could  compile this automatically by using a public games dataset (e.g lichess) and a high quality opening dataset and optionally a chess engine (flagging as mistakes all moves that deviate from an opening database, but perhaps, also are below a certain engine score). This could be further sliced by game speed (classical,rapid, blitz etc). I think it could be nice for teaching and learning.",1609308310

2482,The Craziest Engine Line Of All Time,chess,"So I was looking at lines for The Petrov, Modern Attack, an Opening I've been studying to play in online games and tournaments, when by pure chance I came across this absolute gold Engine line that is quite possibly the most ridiculous chess line I've seen...ever. My written analysis is below. Enjoy! P.S. Nerf Stockfish.

[Opening: Petrov, Modern Attack, Centre Attack](https://i.redd.it/g9sxkq76a9861.gif)

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4: This is the Modern Attack Variation of the Petrov Defense (or Russian Game). This opening has been played many times from beginner right up to Super Grandmaster levels.

3... exd4: less common that Nxe4, but still perfectly playable

4. e5 Ne4 5. Qxd4 f4!?: Much less common than d4, as overpushing the f pawn can weaken the King's diagonal. At lower depths engine will give White around a +1.1 advantage in this position, though this rises to +1.5 at around depth 26.

6. exf6 (e.p.) Nxf6 7.Nc3 Nc6 8.Qh4 Nb4??: Below depth 23, Stockfish does not even recognise this move as a blunder. The threat is clear: Nxc2+ forking the King and Rook, winning material. However, White has an incredibly powerful move in the position...

9. Bg5!! Nxc2+ 10.Kd1 Nxa1: Seemingly Black is now just up an entire Rook - or if the Knight is trapped, at least an exchange. However, Black has inadequate Kingside development, and the pin on the f6 Knight is going to be crippling to Black's position.

11. Nd5: Applying more pressure to the pinned piece, which is now attacked 3 times. This is the only winning move in the position.

11...Be7 12. Bc4!: The lack of f pawn has now completely destroyed Black's chances of castling, as O-O?? Nxf6++ is forced mate, due to the Bishop now having x-ray vision on the g8 square. Bc4 is the only winning move in the position.

12...c6 13. Re1!: Completely leaving the Knight hanging and bringing another attacker into the game, Morphy style. The Bishop of course no longer provides protection to the Knight on f6, and so will fall shortly. As the Black kingside gets opened up, the lack of King safety is going to overwhelm any material advantage.

13...cxd5 14. Bxf6 gxf6 15. Qh5+ Kf8 16. Ne5!!: Both the Bishop and Knight are completely hanging, yet Black's position is still destroyed. Black is forced to capture the Knight as allowing Qf7+/# is mate in 6 after Kg8. It is crucial that both White's Bishop and Knight have (x-ray) vision on the f7 square, which just cannot be adequately defended (16...Qe8 17. Qh6+ Kg8 18. Bxd5+ Qf7 19. Bxf7#)

16...fxe5 17. Bxd5: White threatens Mate on f7, which cannot be defended, as Qe8 allows Qh6#. Now, all White has to do is drag the Black King down the board.

17... Kg7 18. Qf7+ Kh6 19. Rxe5: Only winning move, threatening Rh5#

19...Bg5 20. h4 Rg8 21. f4!: The Bishop is unable to move or capture either pawn as it is interposing Rh5#, so White can push both pawns and then capture the Bishop so the pawns defend each other.

21...d6 22. fxg5+ Rxg5 23. hxg5+ Qxg5: The pawns can perform the captures in either order, as the positions transpose.

24. Qf8+ Kh5 25. Bf3+ Kh4: Bg4 and Kg6 are both tries, but those both leads to mate in 4. The Black King is way too exposed, and despite White only having three pieces, the rule of +2 applies...and Black only has one piece defending the King, so 3 pieces (especially Queen and Rook) is more than enough to mate the Black King on the edge of the board.

26. g3+ Kxg3 27. Rxg5+ Bg4: Now the engine does what engines do - sacrifice all their pieces to slow down the mate.

28. Rxg4+ Kf2 29. Qe7: Qe2# is simply unstoppable.

29...Re8 30. Qxe8 Nc2 31. Qe2# 1-0

Moral of the story: While White may have been down heaps of material, White won the game based on 2 very basic principles.

1) Black had no development. Having extra pieces means nothing if they remain on the backrank for the entire game. The Queen, The Light-Squared Bishop, The Knight on a1 and The Rook on a8 had no bearing on the game, and therefore Black was playing down 4 pieces.

2) Black's King wasn't safe. Sacrificing material is much more effective on an unsafe King. Black never had the opportunity to castle, and the simple difference between pushing the f-pawn and the d-pawn in the opening made all the difference.

I hope that this line was both interesting and informative :)",1609306067

I'm rated 1600s lichess. I just played a game in which I blundered in a relatively complicated tactical position and I'm hoping those of you rated higher than me could give me some advice as to what I could've done better.

I had an advantage out of the opening, but I don't think I pressed my advantage as well as I could have. 

Then there was a critical sequence of moves that started with a blunder from him on move 17, then another from me 3 moves later, giving away the game essentially. I got lucky that he blundered again later on and I ended up winning, but I think there are a couple areas I can learn from here and would appreciate some advice.

First is regarding the 5 or so moves leading up to 15..Nc6. I suspect I could have played them better, but I'm not sure exactly how.

The second is regarding moves 16 to 20 or so. This is where I made my big mistake. Things got very tactical and I sort of just broke down. I'm wondering if anyone has advice for such a position that I can take with me into future games?",1609305129

2503,Either I lost to cheaters or I played horribly or both,chess," I joined a discord call with some old friends who I had not spoken to in  a while.  I had been playing quite a fair bit of chess recently and gotten decent.  I was 1412 on chessdotcom rapid which puts me in the top 89th  percentile (I'm not claiming to be good, but I am not bad) and I play vs good opponents on lichess anonymous and think I  have some good games.

  So I play vs this guy on discord call with my screen shared and people  watching. In the first game he falls for a stupid knight fork secured by  bishop after like 5 moves, takes ages to move and then takes my knight  with his queen and then my bishop takes his queen when he could have  just moved king and lost just a rook instead.  Come on that is just a noob player who makes really silly moves, surely. 

Next  game he plays way better, it is much harder and I play stupid bad moves.  I find it hard to think when I am nervous, not only playing but also  socially talking to these people for the first time in a while.  He then mercs me and I resign. The next game he just plays really good moves and  destroys me, insane complex forks, the best moves possible.  I don't understand how he goes from so bad to insane. Is it me playing  bad or is he cheating with an engine? 

 After that I played my friend who I had played a few years ago and we  were equal. I had played much more since then and thought I was  definitely better since I don't think he has played much since then at all. He destroys me with 98% accuracy. I don't understand why it was so hard  and why I am playing so badly. I am panicking. I am so angry and upset.  I enjoyed chess before this. I took pride in being decent and now it  seems like I have been destroyed by some people who don't play much (or cheated idk). 

It has ruined my pride, I am 2nd guessing if I was ever any good. Still I play bad under pressure. Can't play at all with people watching. I just don't understand. I need some reassurance.",1609299045

2518,Opinion: Studying Openings is Not as Useful for Beginner and Even Lower Level Intermediate Players.,chess,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello Friends,

I made a video about why I think their is a huge misconception about the need to study openings as a beginner. I will summarize here on this post because I am NOT just trying to promote my content. Rather I would like to know others opinions on this subject.

1. I think that (aside from traps) the advantage gained out of an opening is just not as useful to lower rated players. For example, being a pawn up in the middle game gave absolutely no indication of who was going to actually win the game when I was rated around 1000 on [chess.com](https://chess.com/)
2. Opening skills are less transferable than studying other facets of the chess game. My idea here is that learning a specific move in a specific position is inherently less useful then understanding thematic purposes in chess. For example, when you study the Rook and King vs. King endgame, your not just learning how to win that endgame, you are learning more about how the rook moves, controls squares, and works with other pieces (the king in this case). This is more transferable to the middle game and even openings. Other transferable exercises are puzzles, when it comes down to it, chess is about visualizing moves that haven't happened yet and reading the board, puzzles force players to do this and get better at it.
3. I feel like there is a misconception that beginners who lose during the opening should study openings. At first this makes sense, but when I dig deeper, I feel as though beginners are not losing because they do not ""know openings"", rather they are losing because they simply haven't developed their chess skills yet. By focusing on openings these players are just delaying their blunders until the middle game where thematically they might make the same mistakes because openings focus so heavily on the ""how"" and not enough on the ""why""

I am interested in how everyone feels about this.

(P.S. I play mostly online blitz and am rated around 1500)

What looks naturally to me is to move Rb1 and then push forward the b-pawn, but they don't do so in any tutorial videos I have watched and I don't understand why. Instead they just develop on the kingside.  

So what is the reason pushing the b-pawn apperantly not is considered good? And does this pawn structure have a name so I can find more videos about it?",1609288028

I've lost at many things in my life, I've failed exams, I got fired from a job when I was younger, I've lost money on investments, I've been rejected by a girl, I've been refused a promotion etc etc and none of them feel the same as losing at chess...

I'm not talking about 1 bullet or blitz game, or even several games but when you've played 50 or 100 longer time control games over a period of weeks and you really gave it your absolute best and after 100 games you've won like 20... God it's so demoralising. It feels like you wasted so much energy, that your best effort was pathetic, that you failed 80 out of 100 exams. 

I know it's just a game but I can't shake the emotion that comes with consistently getting your ass handed to you despite my best efforts.

I've posted a few times about this sort of stuff and it's also just ""go see a therapist"" or ""you might have some deeper seeded issues"" etc and that might be true but I would like to know at least I'm not alone and this is actually more common than it seems.",1609287194

These are too long for me to calculate myself, but if I were to experimentally check every time it was safe to do so (and I had no other clearly winning plan) I think I'd have found at least a couple of these.

This way I was wondering if someone can recommend a resource to learn a system to get somewhat solidly out of the Sicilian and naturally continuing the game? (with the theory part being as simple as possible)",1609282524
2544,How do I improve my sense of initiative/attack?,chess,"I love attacking chess, and my favorite player is Kasparov. But it feels like I am... missing something when I play. I spend far too long calculating threatening lines my *opponent* has than lines *I* have. I'm more scared of my opponent's initiative than I am focused on mine.

In so many positions I'll have a big attack on the horizon, and any grandmaster would never hesitate to choose my position over my opponent's. Sometimes the computer evaluation is super high too (yesterday I had white in an Austrian Attack Pirc, got a crushing +5 position, and failed to convert!), but even if it's only +0.9 like in typical Sicilian Dragon positions, white's game is obviously more promising. But within a few moves I'll often completely spoil the attack, and in positions like those of the Dragon my opponent's counterplay gains the few critical tempi needed to catch up and pose *me* serious issues instead. I tend to be more acutely aware of my opponent's sacrificial attacking possibilities than my own, which makes me overcautious since I often fail to spot promising continuations for myself but consistently do for my opponent. If I have to sit back and play defense as white in a Dragon, I've messed it up already, but that's often what happens. The same can often occur in Najdorf Englishes, which I often play with white too. I see potential danger 4 moves down the road but fail to see attacking possibilities 2 moves down the road, which leads me to make overly defensive moves in these super sharp attacking lines which I like, which often costs me material and the game.

In reverse, with the black pieces, I tend to stumble when playing black in my favorite King's Indian if my opponent either knows his theory sufficiently or gets some initiative himself, but I *also* stumble when playing *against* the King's Indian with the white pieces. I like to play an aggressive Samisch with O-O-O. When I have black in these exact same kinds of positions, I can't quite figure out how to attack their king, whereas when I do it with white, somehow I'm getting mated down the b-file. My best-performing opening is probably the Sveshnikov with black, but I'm guessing that's mostly due to my opponents not understanding it and getting worse positions out of the opening regularly (they frequently either allow d5 or give up d5), not because I have the understanding required to truly play the Sveshnikov as intended against strong opposition, where sacking a couple of queenside and/or center pawns for attacking compensation is par for the course.

Strangely, my best games tend to be strategic efforts. With white in a Closed Ruy Lopez, I can play very well indeed. Sometimes I lose anyway, of course, I'm not pretending I can play the Closed Ruy to perfection. But I seem to have *way* better, more consistent results with it than the Yugoslav or the English.

I feel like I might almost naturally have more defensive tendencies as a player, sort of like a Petrosian (though obviously his sense of danger and understanding of chess was way better than mine will probably ever be), but I really want to play aggressively like a Kasparov or Shirov because that's what makes chess interesting for me. Does anyone have any tips on how to try to hone my aggressive instincts and allow me not to muck up these sharp openings as badly?",1609282054
2545,Climbing the Rating Ladder: Where are they now?,chess,"I have been binging my way through John Bartholomew's  (/u/scandinaviandefense) ""[Climbing the Rating Ladder](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl9uuRYQ-6MCBnhtCk_bTZsD8GxeWP6BV)"" videos, which have been absolutely amazing and really helped me understand the basics of chess. My current dream is to ever have a chance to be beaten by him myself. It got me curious about how his opponents he played are doing now in their chess life, so I decided to gather some data.

The videos are obviously designed to educate the watchers, and not the opponent, so this is absolutely not reflective of the quality of education. I think his channel and series being one of the most recommended ones for beginners for years should be the proper affirmation of its quality. I just like gathering pointless data and looking at it. There is no purpose to this.

Notes: 

* For the purposes of the data, I grabbed the date of upload and not the date the game was played (although these were not significantly different dates).
* If based the rating on the same time control they played against John; if they didn't play that time control anymore I used the nearest time control (Blitz -&gt; Bullet), but that only occurred a couple of times.
* ""Inactive"" for status means they have closed their own account more than a year ago, or have not played in more than a year since today.
* For averages and medians, I excluded banned players who I counted as a rating of 0.

2561,Chess Endings || Rook plus Pawn Win Against Rook,chess,"Rook endings can sometimes be quite hard sometimes.

On the other hand, I believe that there are only a few positions or ideas that are necessary to memorize.

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""Memorize? Not a problem for me\\""](https://preview.redd.it/bt7ed46r57861.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5071b194c69ea9d2389897336f28ccd661cd589)

Today I’ll show you the key idea in positions on which a rook plus a pawn (except a or h-pawn) can win against a rook.

If the stronger side (the side having the extra pawn) manages to get the king in front of the pawn and pushes the pawn to the 7th rank (second if Black), we would get this kind of position:

&amp;#x200B;

[White to play](https://preview.redd.it/ct4bstsv57861.jpg?width=568&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82efaa1de6f73687d8c6e58f2f00a2934ccdc050)

In this position, taken from the game played between Joerg Pachow and Yuri Alekseyevich Zimmerman in Budapest (2001) after 62 moves, White wins win the move 63.Re4!, **bringing the rook to the fourth rank** (fifth rank if Back). The main idea is that after 63...Kd6 64.Kf7 Rf2+ 65.Kg6 Rg2+ 66.Kf6 Rf2+ 67.Kg5 Rg2+ 68.Rg4 Black runs out of checks

Keep in mind this winning idea as many rook endings can liquidate into similar endings with only one pawn on the board. These winning positions are called the ‘Lucena position’. In any case, the name is not important, what matters is understanding the winning idea.

I kind of stumbled into a new set of tactics for me that is basically about **forcing a swap on every move**, rapidly clearing 3/4 of the pieces from the board, with the intention of getting into an end game with a small pawn advantage, or just a pawn position advantage. 

I've found this strategy works particularly well, especially if I go up a point early in the match, to initiate a bloodbath sequence of 8 or so swaps. On the other side of the bloodbath, the extra pawn is often enough to eke out a win in the endgame.

The general strength of this seems to be that by forcing swaps, you are severely limiting the opponent's options for moves.   I was surprised that my rating increased to \~1300 so far. 

I am interested in growing as a person and a player, so I was curious if anyone had any wisdom on whether there was anything that makes this tactic terribly amateur? Is there is a fundamental flaw in this strategy?",1609276752

My brother just brought it to me and I was wondering if anyone has ever seen a set like this or knew anything about it?

I know the basic opening principles and I'm looking for suggestions for a go-to opening that I can play as White, and a go-to response to 1.e4 and 1.d4 as Black, so that I can focus on tactics/the midgame and not learn a bunch of opening theory as a new player.

As White, would trying to play the Italian Game be a decent 'standard opening'? It's what I end up doing naturally so far. As Black I'm kind of lost - any suggestions for beginner-friendly responses to 1.e4 and 1.d4 that I can learn?

By beginner-friendly I guess I'm looking for something where I don't have to memorise a bunch of variations and where small deviations from perfect aren't a dealbreaker.

How do I go about learning chess in the best way? I am a beginner, I only learned how the pieces move when I was younger but didn't really get that much into it.

I got an account on chess . com and I played few games with bots, few with real people. My rating is now 761(after 5 games 4-1, against the bots I'm maybe 1100). I enjoy playing, but I don't usually have any sort of a plan, I just watch the board and try to cover my pieces and attack if it is super obvious. So those wins seem more of a lucky strike. chess.com has those training lessons which seem super helpful but I'm only free member.

What would you recommend for improvement? Should I get some books?(if so which ones are best for beginner general knowledge) Should I just go to lichess since that one is free and try puzzles? Not sure what the most efficient way of going forward is. I'm not looking to be winning any tournaments(kind of old for that now), just have some fun and understand the game better.

2628,Variation of USCF Rated Player Strength Across The Country,chess,"Hi Everyone!  


After taking a long hiatus from the game, Im now starting to study chess again with the hope of eventually playing in local tournaments once the clubs begin opening up again in my area.  


Back when I was active in USCF rated chess my rating was about 1600, but I primarily played in a different state than the one that I live in now.  I'm curious would there be much of a variation of player  strength when you compare say a 1800 player from Georgia  to an 1800 player in New York City?  I'd imagine certain pockets of the country have stronger chess communities than others so depending on what kind of player pool you're in, the resulting player strength, despite rating, may vary.

I pretty much only know the basics like what way the pieces move, the fact the king can't put itself in checkmate and that white goes first. Playing a game out of curiosity against a friend it felt like my mind was blank to the board beyond the next 1-2 moves that might happen. I guess I just wonder how difficult it is from this position of never having played and being 24 and also not really every playing any strategy type games.

How long would it take to get even a basic understanding of the game? Do I have to commit hours every day for that?

World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen will be out for revenge against Champions Chess Tour leader Wesley So when the first Major of the 2021 Champions Chess Tour kicks off on December 26th. The 12-player tournament runs until January 3rd and has a $200,000 prize fund, with the winner picking up $60,000 and a guaranteed place in the grand final next September. [Airthings](https://www.airthings.com/), who produce world-leading radon and indoor air quality monitors, is partnering with the Tour and will measure the air quality in the players’ homes as they play.

The Champions Chess Tour will, for the first time in history, determine the world’s best chess player over a full competitive season of online chess. Beginning in November 2020, the Champions Chess Tour will feature monthly tournaments culminating in a final tournament in September 2021. The best chess players in the world will compete in a total of ten tournaments of rapid chess. In the end, the tour champion will rightly be considered the strongest online speed chess player in the world. Viewers can get the most out of the Champions Chess Tour experience with a [chess24 Premium Pass](https://chess24.com/en/premium) (€14,99/month) or a [Deluxe VIP Package](https://shop.chess24.com/collections/special-event-tickets/products/champions-chess-tour-vip-pass) (€4.999,00).

***

**Participants**

The lineup includes the eight players who qualified as the top 8 on the Champions Chess Tour after the first event, the Skilling Open, which was won by Wesley So after a thrilling final victory over Magnus Carlsen. Those players are joined by Spanish Champion David Anton, who was voted back into the Airthings Masters despite finishing outside the qualifying places, and Russian 3-time World Blitz Champion Alexander Grischuk, who won the second public vote among Chess24 premium members.

They’re also joined by two wild cards, Russia’s Daniil Dubov, who was the only player other than Magnus to win an event on the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour, and India’s Pentala Harikrishna, who has been ranked as high as world no. 10.

**Format/Time Controls**

The first 9 tournaments of the Champions Chess Tour will have the same structure:

* A 3-day round-robin (16 players for each Regular event and 12 for each Major). 

* The top 8 players advance to a six-day knockout, with two days each for the quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. 

The time controls used in the Champions Chess Tour will be the same as for the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour:

* Rapid: 15'+10"" (each player has 15 minutes for all moves, with a 10-second increment after each move)

* Blitz: 5'+3""

* Armageddon: White has 5 minutes to Black’s 4, with no increments. If the game is drawn, Black wins the match.

A total of 100 Tour points are at stake in the Airthings Masters (20 for finishing 1st in the preliminary rounds, and 80 for winning the final). Tour points are important since the top 8 players on the Tour will automatically be invited to the next tournament.

I decided to do some research about Drueke. The pieces are nice and well crafted. A full set of pieces goes for around $250 on E-Bay. Then I found this site with an exhaustive history of the Wm. F. Drueke &amp; Co. complete with a timeline of the life of the man himself, William F. Drueke, According to his obit he manufactured the first chess pieces in the United States (imported previously) and did so to fill a gap left by World War I.

And Stockfish is frozen. (I only see the hourglass)

This is incredibly bizarre to me. White only has one legal move, Kf1. Why wouldn't Stockfish suggest this move instantly then proceed to evaluate the numerical value of the position, if that's what it's getting hung up on?

Any other third move for black is fine, ie 3...Nc6 and I get the suggestions from Stockfish instantly.

2732,I was disqualified from a tournament as a kid and I don't understand why,chess,"Let me share something that happened to me when I was 8 or 9 years old. I was enjoying playing chess at home and I got into a ""chess club"" at school - it was really just kids playing chess while a teacher was sitting nearby - we didn't learn any theory, we also did not have chess clocks. 

But after some time the best player (which was me) was sent to a tournament at some other school. They had clocks and I only learnt how to use them there. Someone told me that if my time runs out then the red flag drops, and then I lose. Fair enough. 

So I played some games and then went ahead to watch one of the games that were still in progress. There was a little crowd watching. Then one of the players lost on time, the flag dropped, and I said something like ""the flag dropped"" to a guy that was standing next to me. But the kid who lost on time heard that, he started crying, a judge appeared, and they told him what happened. 

After this, I was promptly disqualified for ""prejudging the result of a game"". Can anyone tell me why? Are you not allowed to say anything about the game you're watching, even if one of the players clearly lost?

I was of course really ashamed when this happened and I think I did not mention this situation to anyone. I was very embarassed that I did something that was clearly very wrong, even though I did not understand what happened. Incidentally, I also stopped playing chess as a kid because of this (but now, after 20 years and watching Queen's Gambit, I'm re-discovering this amazing game)",1609190477

2738,Will OTB Chess every be the same? Where can it go from here?,chess,"Where I live, OTB classical has been dying off at an alarming pace over the past 10 years. Before I stopped studying chess I was a candidate Master looking to become a FM. I've recently found my love for chess again and would like to finish the journey I started.  
When COVID is behind us and over the board play returns, how do you think it will pan out for the future of classical chess?  Clearly the recent internet/COVID boom has revealed a more direct way of reaching players of all levels, but I feel that classical chess is not able to tap into this effectively. My opinion is that  shrinking popularity for classical chess, and increased cheating is extremely harmful to the future of OTB classical. 

Currently, it is very difficult to hold online rated tournaments without cheating being a direct issue, or the possibility of cheating deterring stronger players from participating. Frankly, I don't blame anyone who doesn't want to play rated online. The chess federation in my country has had such issues, but does not take it seriously. Lax punishments and lack of ant-cheating methods really cast doubts into the authenticity of rated events. I would hate to be in a game and  having to deal with the suspicions of my opponent being a potential cheater.  Even if it's not the case, the idea will creep into your thoughts and ruin the enjoyment, and/or  your ability to think clearly.

I would be more than happy to play online with more concrete methods of detection, and harsher punishments for cheating,, but as stands that isn't the case it seems. What are your thoughts? Do you think improvements can be made in the near future to improve the state of classical chess? Or will there be more expansion into shorter time controls, and possibly allowing titles to be awarded in shorter controls?

This probably sounds like a rather basic question. I still wanted to ask, though. I have been playing for around two years now. I am fluctuating around 1200 and 1450 on chess.com

I am mostly playing 10/0 lately, but have been playing 3/0 and 3/2 most of the time before I realized I started developing some bad habits into my play. I play a lot of Puzzles. My rating for puzzles has been bouncing between 1900 and 2100. However, I feel like there is something fundamentally wring with my play. The discrepancy between my puzzle rating and playing strength is so severe, that I feel like I am missing some key component. I understand that one‘s puzzle rating might be naturally higher than their blitz rating - just by how the elo system works. Yet, none of my chess buddies is close to my puzzle rating but many of them play much better than me. 

Has/is anyone in a similar situation, and do you have some advice for me?

2742,Advice for improving in Blitz and Bullet?,chess,"Hey everyone, I've been playing chess regularly for the past three years or so, but I didn't really start caring about my rating until about a year ago. Since then, my rapid rating on chess.com has gotten up to 1400 (1500 at one point but it has dropped since then), but my bullet and blitz ratings have barley improved at all and have been hovering between 1000-1100 for a long time. I'm guessing that this is because I'm not a very intuitive player. I do better when I have time to calculate a bunch of different lines before making my move, and I've never understood how some players can just throw their pieces around the board with nothing but pure instinct and somehow refrain from making horrible mistakes.

2743,Making multiple accounts,chess,"I know that loosing a shit ton of games in a row, or something else horrific happening can make a person want to start over fresh. But it is just not worth it.

As chess players we have to embrace the grind, and the ups and downs. I feel like people put way too much weight into their rating and how they appear to other people. But at the end of the day improving in chess means losing... alot. And when you finally do get to that achievement that you have been working for whether its 1200 or 2200 knowing that you can look back and see your progression will be beautiful.

Im saying this because a few months ago I deleted my lichess account in a rage after losing 100 rating points in a day (I know). But on this new account I've been grinding on, I've had the same amount of trouble. But I finally got to 2200 like I wanted.

2751,In the italian: Why Knight f5? How exactly to get the queen involved on the kingside attack?,chess,"As white, I play some variations of the italian, mainly the fried liver, and the the guiocco pianisimo variations. I know getting the b1 knight to f5 is generally good, i see how the preassure in g7 is strong, i see the potential for tactics and other mating patterns. This would all be great if black's Light Squared Bishop didn't start out in c8 with direct vision of that square, and most times didn't even move in the whole rest of the game.

When i get my Knight to e3 or g3 I either: **1-Don't ever move it** from there until there's a decent trade, since the bishop always covers. *(which I feel is too pasive)*, **2-Put it on f5 and trade** with the bishop *(which I feel is an awful trade*, a piece i've moved 4 times for an undeveloped bishop which isn't even playing) **3-Put it on f5 before oponent plays d6** (which is almost ideal)

On this last case i have two problems: what do i do after my oponent almost inmediately plays d6? Do i just accept that the trade is going to happen? do i retreat? do i sac the knight or the bishop on h6 if possible? what if the pawn hasn't moved to h6? Lastly, how do i get the queen involved? I usually put my knight on h4, the queen on f3, and then slide it to g3, there's gotta be a better way I'm not seeing, and stockfish isn't suggesting lol

I know this is kind of a rant and I know there are many questions, but I've been increasing my rating, and more and more my games are getting to these more tactical positions that they weren't before, and I'm not getting the ideas in the middle game for my favourite opening. Thanks very much!

2757,"New: DGT for Chess.com macOS App (unofficial, Beta)",chess,"Lately, I got into chess after years of not playing, and I just fell in love with it again. I really like Chess.com yet I wanted to improve OTB (over the board) games. Being a programmer I instantly looked for some good options and found DGT Board to be a popular choice for electronic powered boards. I then got one and noticed the Chess.com's implementation of DGT eBoards as input for games is super flakey, most of the time it straight out does not work.

So I decided to develop a proper implementation to allow the use of DGT eboards on Chess.com, not only on **Online play** but also on **Computer play** and even **Explorer** for analyzing your games!

🤩 Features:

* 🗣️ Move announcements - When your opponent / you make a move, they are announced by voice AI. 
* 🖥️ Online play - Use your DGT eboard to play against online opponents on Chess.com.
* 🤖 Computer play - Use your DGT eboard to play against all computer bots on Chess.com.
* 📈 Explorer play - Use your DGT eboard in this mode to physically analyze your games or positions while getting validation and announcement for moves made.
* 🔌 Multiple Connection Engines - Choose between using DGT LiveChess 2.0 and our Embedded connection engine which is much faster \*(Embedded highly recommended on MacOS)\*.
* 🟢 Board Status Dialog - See the status of your board during the game, including battery life, connection status, and sync status.

**Link to get the app:**

[https://github.com/amitassaraf/dgt-for-chess.com](https://github.com/amitassaraf/dgt-for-chess.com)

It is open-source so you can package it yourself or download it through my Gummyroad ($0+).

*Note: Only supported on macOS right now, will take a day or so to support on Windows if you'll want it*

My question for those who play chess and would actually have something of an answer for this/these question(s): was Bobby Fischer really one of the truly great chess players? Did his story/fame/notoriety (the “I cannot play under these lights”/American vs the Soviet Union notoriety, not the “Jews are all evil” notoriety) make him out to seem greater than he was at all? When it comes down purely to the game itself, how good was he really?

2769,The Bar God is a cruel mistress when you're bad at chess,chess,"I've played chess sporadically since I was a kid, but I've only just bothered to start actually *learning to play*, as opposed to just mucking around with friends who are equally bad at chess.

Anyway, I've just played a rapid game on the chess.com app on my phone. The problem was that the app froze after the 3rd or 4th move. I tried everything I could to unfreeze it, but the board and the timers remained unchanged on my opponent's move. Since I'm bad at chess, what little rating I've managed to acquire is precious to me - especially as I've been on a losing streak over the last few weeks and have only just started trending upwards again - so I didn't want to resign. I messaged my opponent that the game had frozen for me, and offered a draw. For some reason, offering the draw unfroze the app, leaving it my move, with 5 minutes to my opponent's 10.

Luckily for this match my game is faster than it is accurate (in fact, one of the biggest things I have to work on is slowing down and analysing more before making a move), although I'm not yet knowledgeable enough or good enough at recognising patterns to translate that into being good at Blitz. So I'm playing catch-up with my time and getting myself into a bad position while doing so. I'm losing for a good 15-20 moves, although I am regaining time, until I make a good move (or they make a mistake), and I manage to turn the tables and spend another 10-15 moves chasing their king to the middle of the board and delivering a checkmate with 50 seconds on the clock to their 2 minutes.

Or so I thought. I do what I always do after a match and analyse the game, only to be told that after about 8 moves I was winning solidly throughout the whole match. It's just that there were 4 or 5 checkmates that I simply didn't see. I also missed a Botez gambit they offered, which would have simplified my life considerably.

There's nothing that's quite so much of a reminder of how far you've got left to go than to congratulate yourself heartily because you think you snatched victory out of the jaws of defeat, only to learn that you had the upper hand all along but are just too bad at the game to have seen it.

2774,Why am I not improving in chess?,chess,"A little backstory:
Me and a few of my mates picked up chess two years ago and have been playing it ever since, for the first month or two we've been playing for fun and never really spent the time memorising openings or watching pros play. I, embarrassingly, still don't know what the numbers mean, like 800, 1200, 2800 etc. But eventually, we found chess really fun, and joined our school's chess club.

I can easily memorise openings, tactics, traps opponents set and how to avoid them, but when it comes to the actual board, my mind just blanks. I can barely predict a move ahead of me, hell, I can barely memorise how the pieces work once I sit down in front of the board, I once played chess like it was shoji and only realised halfway through, and the two games are pretty much nothing alike.

After about a year of playing, I can see my friend's improve drastically, yet I was still stuck on the same level that I was. Games that I play in barely hit ten minutes before a checkmate happens or some piece takes my king, my friends told me it was just a matter of time, but now, another year later, I'm still about on the same level that I was on.

Am I just going to be stuck on this level of playing, or will I gradually become better? I've also been playing online for about a year and a half and I'm floating around the 600 rating, whatever that means. 

(By the way, I'm no means a Grandmaster at Go or Shoji, but I definitely can hold my own against more experienced players, I've been playing Shoji for about 3 years and Go for around two years. But I've definitely improved and can actually ""predict"")

We only want to return rarely to opening preparation, and so I very much recommend this approach.

I’ve been getting into chess and finally getting somewhere and I’ve been practicing with the bots on chess.com, specifically a 1200 bot called Maria to practice defending against the queens gambit. So finally I’m getting to a place where I’m not dead right away and can actually develop way into my middle game, and well. However usually the bot will take either horizontally or vertically and often times mess up my chances. This includes in my last games a black pawn on c4 taking a white pawn that moved to b4 and and a black pawn on h3 taking my knight on h2. In this last case the game resulted in a check mate because my king was on g1. 
My questions (as in the title) are if there are chess rules that allow a pawn to take other than diagonally and also if anyone has been experiencing troubles with bots.

They have plenty of videos about different openings, but I just feel very good playing e4 every game as white and e5 as black to see if I can do that Gambit (the Knight f6 Queen e7 one, I feel like it's really good VS Queen pawn because chances are, at this elo (800) they will play London a lot).

When you started playing chess, did you study a bunch of openings or did you stick to one?

Of course I have learned different options like Kings Indian, London, Queens Gambit, Scandinavian, Danish Gambit, Slav... But I feel like e4 is so easy to play that if I play anything else I'm gonna miss a lot of things (specially the Kings Indian, I don't know why but it's so hard to play to me)

On one side there is the ruling party who has been in control for almost 20 years, on the other side there is a new group supported by all Brazilian major players from the present and the past, including the Top 3 players of the Brazilian Rating ranking (GM Leitão, GM Supi, GM Krikor). 

The major complaint against the ruling party is that they are persecuting and repressing players who do not support their administration. Apparently, they are not allowing players to participate in big tournaments and refuse to promote or recognize players who do not agree with them. 

The first time I heard this I thought it was just some kind of election Trash-Talking, but two days ago ex-Brazilian champion IM Roberto Molina [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flgFLk_je8Q) exposing many emails he changed with CBX official communication channel just before the 2018 Brazilian national championship. 

In the emails, the CBX: 

* Showed lots of disrespect and even insulted him. 

* Created new rules that were not in the regulations of the tournament solely to not allow him to participate. 

* Tried to intimidate him by implying he was a criminal and asking for information about his job that absolutely was not related to the tournament. 

IM Molina got first place in the regional classification event but CBX simply removed his name from the list of classified players. His participation was only confirmed just some days before the event because he had to move a lawsuit against the confederation.

Ironically he won the whole thing and was declared the 2018 Brazilian Champion, but now CBX treats him like a pariah. 

Many Brazilian top players are telling they experienced similar situations. I write this in hope that it can reach someone from FIDE, maybe they can conduct an investigation and do something against CBX.",1609404946

World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen will be out for revenge against Champions Chess Tour leader Wesley So when the first Major of the 2021 Champions Chess Tour kicks off on December 26th. The 12-player tournament runs until January 3rd and has a $200,000 prize fund, with the winner picking up $60,000 and a guaranteed place in the grand final next September. [Airthings](https://www.airthings.com/), who produce world-leading radon and indoor air quality monitors, is partnering with the Tour and will measure the air quality in the players’ homes as they play.

The Champions Chess Tour will, for the first time in history, determine the world’s best chess player over a full competitive season of online chess. Beginning in November 2020, the Champions Chess Tour will feature monthly tournaments culminating in a final tournament in September 2021. The best chess players in the world will compete in a total of ten tournaments of rapid chess. In the end, the tour champion will rightly be considered the strongest online speed chess player in the world. Viewers can get the most out of the Champions Chess Tour experience with a [chess24 Premium Pass](https://chess24.com/en/premium) (€14,99/month) or a [Deluxe VIP Package](https://shop.chess24.com/collections/special-event-tickets/products/champions-chess-tour-vip-pass) (€4.999,00).

***

**Participants**

The lineup includes the eight players who qualified as the top 8 on the Champions Chess Tour after the first event, the Skilling Open, which was won by Wesley So after a thrilling final victory over Magnus Carlsen. Those players are joined by Spanish Champion David Anton, who was voted back into the Airthings Masters despite finishing outside the qualifying places, and Russian 3-time World Blitz Champion Alexander Grischuk, who won the second public vote among Chess24 premium members.

They’re also joined by two wild cards, Russia’s Daniil Dubov, who was the only player other than Magnus to win an event on the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour, and India’s Pentala Harikrishna, who has been ranked as high as world no. 10.

**Format/Time Controls**

The Airthings Masters will kick off on 26 December with twelve players and a brand-new format. The first 9 tournaments of the Champions Chess Tour will have the same structure:

* A 3-day round-robin (16 players for each Regular event and 12 for each Major). 

* The top 8 players advance to a six-day knockout, with two days each for the quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. 

The time controls used in the Champions Chess Tour will be the same as for the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour:

* Rapid: 15'+10"" (each player has 15 minutes for all moves, with a 10-second increment after each move)

* Blitz: 5'+3""

* Armageddon: White has 5 minutes to Black’s 4, with no increments. If the game is drawn, Black wins the match.

A total of 100 Tour points are at stake in the Airthings Masters (20 for finishing 1st in the preliminary rounds, and 80 for winning the final). Tour points are important since the top 8 players on the Tour will automatically be invited to the next tournament.

I have previously discussed with other Redditors about a possible course on the Sicillian Grand Prix since I have played this throughout my life and with the help of latest Engines and hardware, I think I am very good for the opening (I am a 2550 Lichess Rated Player, 2150+ FIDE)

I have prepared the database and was going to release the Video Course but sadly, a moment before I went to start recording I checked Chessable Author FAQ and found out they take 60% out of every sale and give authors just 40%.

I am unsure whether going through Chessable is the best solution or if I should just host a seminar/workshop and share these files there? If such a thing happens, will anyone be willing to discuss these openings? I charge less around $15/hour (less, but I am from a third world country) and so comparatively - It will be much easier for me to make money through personal coaching than Chessable.

What do you all think? Is going ahead and publishing course (20 hours of video approximately) makes sense? Please let me know what you all think.

2930,What's the most frustrating things for you playing both online and over the board chess?,chess,"As I've been getting better and better at chess, I've found most games end up going to the end game with limited time (I mainly play 3/5 minutes no increment). Time after time I will lose when in a winning position due to running out of time, and not because I couldn't check mate in time, but because I like to play while laying in bed on my laptop. I'll have 20 seconds left where all I have to do is walk a pawn up and queen it, but using my laptop trackpad it takes me 3 seconds minimum to make one move, sometimes more if it doesn't register. Even premoving is a pain in the ass with my old plastic trackpad. 

I'd honestly say 50% of my losses in blitz are ones where I could have easily won with a mouse.",1606817307

I get the unfeasible checkmate one. And obviously I get draw by agreement. I get the 'opponents turn and they can't move anything' - one.

I understand there are two more, which I am not so clear on: 

Draw by repetition - which I've always been a bit unclear about  (where does the threefold repetition begin and end?)

Draw beyond where's it's been fifty moves without a capture or a pawn move.. does this one actually ever happen? I guess the players would agree to a draw long before they've played the 50 moves out in practice?

2939,Noob question. Is a Bishop more valuable than a knight?,chess,"Hello,

So as one of the Queen's Gambit bandwagon players, I have been playing on chess.com and I have noticed that nearly every single time there is a trade on the board, my knight for their bishop, my 500-800 rated opponents take the trade. 

I had assumed, based on their both having a score of 3 points, that they would be more or less equal in value. But as I said, it seems like my opponents always want to take my knight at the cost of their bishop, even if no other pieces are off the board. 

Am I missing something? Is the knight that much better? Is this a matter of tempo? Do the knights have a higher early game value?

Thanks for any help!",1606809064

I want to try and be the second black grandmaster and hopefully bring the sport more too poc primarily black folks who make up such a small peeve of the community. Well anyways I’ve only had experience as a kid and I went from 300-500 in a couple days after only training for about a week now.

Anyone down to play a couple games and help me get better; I’ve been doing a lot of research and still just learning tactics and trying not to hang pieces. Any advice would be helpful from more experienced players. 

Doing some chess analysis my problem is my mid-end game. I seem to start out amazing until I have to go on to the attack; some how most of my wins come from playing black ironically; I’m good at defense but suck on attacking and taking initiatives",1606808057

How do you envision the knight's movement? I've started seeing it as one diagonal move then one outwards as well, but I'm curious what the consensus is.",1606774161

3043,Question about how tournament prizes ~typically~ work,chess,"So, I have been thinking about trying to play in some tournaments when they start being scheduled again (ya know, COVID-19 and all), and so I've been looking online through past tournaments and have a question about the prizes (note: I played in some tournaments as a kid, but they never had prizes). Many tournaments say something like this in their prize section (this tournament has 2 sections, U1600 and Open):

&amp;#x200B;

**Open:** $500, $250, $125, U2200 $100, U2000 $100, U1800 $100,

**U1600:** $300, $150, $100, U1400 $100, U1200 $100, U1000 $100. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I understand the U1400, U1200, and U1000 prizes in their entirety. Are those prizes for the best player in that section under that rating? Like a 1390 could walk away from the tournament with 100$ even without winning? If so, do those stack? For example, if an 800 won the U1600 section (extremely unlikely, I'm aware, but roll with me), would they win the $300 for winning, the $100 for being the best U1400, $100 for being the best U1200, and $100 for being the best U1000, making a $600 prize? Or is the section winner excluded from the Uxx00 prizes? Or, are these limits to the amount of prize money that can be won by people under that rating?

&amp;#x200B;

Also I understand that every tournament is different, but I'm kinda just asking in general what these things mean. All of the tournaments I have seen are done already, so I don't really want to email the TD's asking about tournaments that already happened.

&amp;#x200B;

3046,Question about position after defending Ruy Lopez,chess,"I've been studying how best to handle the Ruy Lopez opening with e5 opening.

I've never posted a sequence for analysis, so not sure if I am doing this right. But does my position as black look OK? It feels ok, that's why I am asking, but I've learned that the visual look doesn't always tell the story.

However, no one takes this pawn!  I've been trying for two or three weeks now, and my rating went up from around 800 to 900 between that time, and even the higher level players never take this pawn.  Only about 1 in every 10 (if I had to estimate) people I think have taken this pawn between all the games I've played.  The Scandinavian is an infamously bad line for black, and I always take the pawn whenever someone plays it against me for that reason.  Is there an opening or something that I'm not aware of which is even better for white?  I thought that at first, but I've seen f3, d3, d4, and even knc3.  There's no consistent ""alternate opening"" that might just be better for white.  Or are they simply scared that since I'm playing such an infamous opening that I'll know everything about it?  If you're someone who doesn't take this pawn, why not?

3152,Thoughts of a unique YouTube Channel (cross posted),chess,"This has not been formed so I am not looking to solicit, I am just looking to see if there would be an audience interested if I were to make a YouTube channel for chess.

This, unlike those by most GM’s or other well known players would follow me, a novice at 31 who is chronically ill, to show anyone can learn. I would overtime show my progression, showing each session a game I played going over the analysis and pointing out where I could have done better, with the help of stronger players including my mentor ahead of time, teaching one or two new terminology words each session and when applicable showing how they are set up, and teaching one opening or end move each session starting easy and getting more difficult as I become more advanced.

This would be primarily set for a novice beginner audience as the pace would be very slow, but unlike other slow based videos typically geared towards children that I find helpful this would be geared towards adults.

I will join chess.com as well as lichess which I am currently on now and if enough interest takes place I will play live sub nights playing with other novices and beginners, letting my viewers know when they will be.

I thought it would be fun to watch a player who  just learned how the pieces moved less then 3 weeks ago progress over the weeks, and hopefully those watching can gain valuable information and learn as well. In addition I will provide a bunch of free sources I have been using to start studying before I start purchasing books which I am sure in the long run I will do but hey if there is free material out there why not take advantage. 

So please let me know if this sounds like something you would be interested in this idea and if so what level you are as I’m curious if other levels would be interested as well.

I have noticed a few things.  For the lower rated player that starts with an advantage, the simplest strategy is to continually trade down.  This is also true in regular chess but it's reinforced when playing against a higher rated player.  For the person that starts with fewer pieces (this is often me), I've noticed that I am attacking aggressively and also disregarding the exact material count.

However, maybe 15% of games I get an undo request for what seem to be blunders. I guess I can't really know, but if you're for instance putting me in check and my bishop was guarding the square you just moved into from across the board, that looks like you just missed it.

I've also had undo requests for bad pre-moves where they misguessed my move.

3204,"For the average player who can only think a few moves ahead, there is actually a large element of situational luck involved in a game between two of these players of similar skill.",chess,"Most chess players can only see a few moves into the future, and then really only if the moves are forced. The average player may learn some opening and positioning principles, but they are by no means capable of picturing the board in 10 moves or controlling the overall situation of the game, and neither is their opponent. 

When it comes down to it, most players just make moves that seem good in the moment based on their learned openings or principles, and eventually may plan some short-term attack or maneuver. If,10 moves after this maneuver begins, the opponent sees some new strategy that arises and wins them material, good on them for spotting the tactic. That certainly required chess skill, but assuming both players are capable of spotting and executing the same short-term tactics, but not of seeing 10 moves into the future to prevent them from arising, is it not a matter of luck which player is presented a winning tactic first?",1606682797

I saw Hikaru Nakamura at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

3263,Steinitz Theory,chess,"Where do players now stand on this? I’ve seen this to be very debatable amongst players. Does the majority of players believe in this concept? To everyone’s knowledge Steinitz was not a romantic chess player. I feel anyone who agrees and plays by these terms must play more positional or conservative chess, rather than in the style of someone such as Morphy or Anderssen.

Steinitz Theory in 7 Key Points to remind anyone who has forgotten- 

• At the beginning of the game, the forces stand in equilibrium.

• Correct play on both sides maintains this equilibrium and leads to a drawn game. 

• Therefore, a player can win only as a consequence of an error by an opponent. (There is no such thing as a winning move.)

• As long as the equilibrium is maintained, an attack, however skillful, cannot succeed against correct defense. Such a defense will eventually necessitate the withdrawal and regrouping of the attacking pieces, and the attacker will then inevitably suffer disadvantage.

• Therefore, a player should not attack until he already has an advantage, caused by the opponent’s error, that justifies the decision to attack.

• At the beginning of the game, a player should not at once seek to attack. Instead, a player should seek to disturb the equilibrium in his favor by inducing the opponent to make an error—a preliminary before attacking.

• When a sufficient advantage has been obtained, a player must attack or the advantage will be dissipated.

A good bet for the strongest generation would appear to be the 90s. Most of these players remained relevant well into the 2000s and 2010s. By the mid-90s, the likes of Ivanchuk, Anand, Kramnik and Kamsky had completely overshadowed the leading members of Kasparov's generation, who were only in their mid-30s then, with the exception of Kasparov himself. 

January 1997 was the last time one of the 80s generation (aside from Kasparov) was inside top 10, when Short was ranked #8, at the age of 32. Whereas Anand, Kramnik, Topalov, Ivanchuk and Gelfand were in the top 10 in their 40s. Anand remained World Champion until he was 44, and his generation prevented the next generation (2000s) from winning the title or even qualifying for a title match. 

Some other observations:

The generation that emerged in the mid to late 50s and early 60s were also very strong, featuring 3 World Champions (Petrosian, Tal, Spassky) and one of the greatest never to become World Champion (Korchnoi). They continued being highly ranked and contested the latter stages of the World Championship cycle well into the 70s and early 80s. 

Though it has been noted that there was a lack of  notable players, especially Soviet ones, to emerge in the 70s. The birthrate had declined during WWII and players who should have been born in the early 40s and been in their prime in the 70s, simply didn't exist. 

Fischer almost ends up being in a group of his own, he is a full 6 years younger than Spassky and 5 years older than Huebner. Notably, he had only a handful of games against players younger than him. Fischer's early retirement and the lack of players his age, perhaps made it easier for Karpov to rise, his main competitors were significantly older than him. Though Karpov later proved himself even against the 90s generation who were 20 years younger than him. 

The 20s generation also appears weakish, Euwe was the only all time great to emerge in this period. Sultan Khan was only relevant for a few years in the early 30s and Kashdan also had a short career at international level. When Alekhine had his famous victory at San Remo in 1930, all his notable competitors were from the 1910s generation or earlier. At Bled 1931, much the same, though Kashdan and Flohr also participated. 

Jury is out on the 2010s generation. Carlsen and Caruana are already all time greats and Karjakin has put together a good resume, though marred with inconsistency.",1606639329

The Skilling Open is the opening leg of the Champions Chess Tour, which spans 10 star-studded online chess tournaments played over 10 months. The event is sponsored by the Nordic trading platform [Skilling](https://skilling.com/row/en/), which has agreed to a 12-month partnership with [Play Magnus](https://www.playmagnus.com/en), and features a $100,000 prize fund. 

The 2021 Champions Chess Tour will, for the first time in history, determine the world’s best chess player over a full competitive season of online chess. Beginning in November 2020, the Champions Chess Tour will feature monthly tournaments culminating in a final tournament in September 2021. The best chess players in the world will compete in a total of ten tournaments of rapid chess. In the end, the tour champion will rightly be considered the strongest online speed chess player in the world. Viewers can get the most out of the Champions Chess Tour experience with a [chess24 Premium Pass](https://chess24.com/en/premium) (€14,99/month) or a [Deluxe VIP Package](https://shop.chess24.com/collections/special-event-tickets/products/champions-chess-tour-vip-pass) (€4.999,00).

**Format/Time Controls**

The Skilling Open will kick off on 22 November with sixteen players and a brand-new format. The first 9 tournaments of the Champions Chess Tour will have the same structure:

* A 3-day round-robin (16 players for each Regular event and 12 for each Major). 
* The top 8 players advance to a six-day knockout, with two days each for the quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. 

The time controls used in the Champions Chess Tour will be the same as for the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour:

* Rapid: 15'+10"" (each player has 15 minutes for all moves, with a 10-second increment after each move)
* Blitz: 5'+3""
* Armageddon: White has 5 minutes to Black’s 4, with no increments. If the game is drawn, Black wins the match.

A total of 50 Tour points are at stake in the Skilling Open (10 for finishing 1st in the preliminary rounds, and 40 for winning the final). Tour points are important since the top 8 players on the Tour will automatically be invited to the next tournament.

3291,chess960 correspondence?,chess,"Recently started playing correspondence chess (2 days per move) and its awesome. These are the pros i noticed:

* You can play whenever you want. Just 5-10 minutes a day is enough.
* You can enjoy chess without time trouble pressure.
* You make way less silly mistakes. Your games end up being beautiful, whether you win or not.

The problem i am facing now is that the openings that worked for me in bullet and blitz are sometimes going into very dull equalish positions. I dont really want to learn new openings either. Which brings me to chess960.

If there are any chess960 lovers who haven't played correspondence, you should give it a try.

Or any correspondence players who haven' t played chess960, why not try it? could be interesting.

I am on lichess.org and [chess.com](https://chess.com). Anyone interested in having a chess960 correspondence game can dm me.",1606628895

3321,(~2000 lichess rating) Anyone interested in learning openings with a crew?,chess,"I have been drilling openings for the last few months. It's hard to practice against real people. When I practice an opening and drill lines, I have to play a dozen or more games online before I get into a situation where I can actually use it. Playing openings against a computer isn't quite the same, because they often play ""non-human"" moves, so it doesn't quite simulate real moves.

I was thinking of putting a group together of a few people who are around my rating range (\~2000 lichess who are looking to practice some openings. We would tell our opponent what they have to play for the first 5-10 moves. They can use a computer for the first 10-15 moves or not, doesn't matter, we'd keep it casual. And then we could all actually practice real openings with a real human opponent. 

I was thinking that we'd meet once a week for 1 hour, and play 3 20 minute games. 1/2 the time you'd be practicing your opening, and the other 1/2 of the time you'd be the guineea pig for someone else.

3324,Any good alternatives to puzzles?,chess,"Hey guys, so basically I'm looking for a way to do puzzles that would be more lenient.

So I'd like to have a,way to do puzzles where if I do a good move instead of the best one it would still be valid. Of course I'd want the software to tell me the best move that I missed but I'd like it to not refuse otherwise good move.

This is because currently I feel like chess.com puzzles aren't helping me that much. I often play moves that seem to win me material or give me a good positon but the software just invalidates them, giving me no way of knowing if it was a blunder or not. Sometimes I can't even see the difference between the move I played and the move it wanted me to play.

3386,It's astounding how much better Tania Sachdev &amp; Peter Leko's commentary is if you already have some grasp on the game,chess,"Tania is an incredible moderator and Leko doesn't waste our time on explaining the most basic of concepts. They also don't constantly reference 'The Bar', instead only using it to supplant the insight Leko and their guest (yesterday's Sam Shankland was fantastic and said the same thing about the bar explicitly) give.

Not trying to put anyone down, the main stream is useful as well, but they're clearly trying to aim it to be more accessible to new players/ those who don't play chess regularly, always talking about the psychology of the players and their situation rather than the board. Tania and Peter speak to the psychology as well, but it's in passing, whereas the main stream seems to speak almost exclusively about the player's mindsets, which, to me, is far less interesting than an analysis of the board or how different player's preferred opening match up against one another.

If you already understand what castling is, I don't think the main stream will help much. They treat it like boxing rather than chess in order to attract a wider audience. Leko's analysis is also perfectly balanced with Tania's ability to keep the conversation going, ask questions beyond ""do you think their confidence is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"", and ensure everyone gets to give their ideas on the new move.

I'm flairing this as News/Events, but honestly I just wanted to notify more people. I was getting turned off of the event from the stale reporting of one stream, and the chess24 stream turned that around for me. I guess I'm a shill",1606589258

I was hoping to play a giuoco piano since I'm currently trying to practice the mainline. I was bit thrown with my opponent reply to Nf3. But I looked it up and apparently it was a very common move anyway, so overall I was pretty happy with my opening

Made a few blunders just after the opening, heading into what I'd would think of as the midgame. Especially with my bishop on c4, at one point I left it unprotected.

Fast forward a bit. Pretty happy with how I avoided a couple queen trades especially since I was down material. Tables started to turn and I was pushing blacks queen thurther back which was nice. I didn't see the checkmate with the pawn and queen though untill it was too late. 

Overall my plain was just to open up my e and d files pushing my rooks up. Then moving my queen up as well delivering checkmate with queen being protected with the rooks. Didn't happen unfortunately because I didn't see blacks checkmate.",1606587466

3399,Suggestions for getting back into chess?,chess,"Greetings all. I never played chess competitively, mainly because I didn't have enough chess knowledge, but I was responsible for creating a chess club in junior high school. Another reason I didn't play competitively is that there weren't that many people interested in playing the game, so after I left school I just dropped off and didn't play for the next 5 years.

Recently, I thought about getting back into chess again, but since I don't have a competitive rating I don't exactly know where to start. If anybody could recommend some good books, and give me some advice on where to start, I'd appreciate it. Joining a club or playing against others over the board isn't an option, since I live in a rural Texas town with very few players and no club to speak of. I thought about joining the free internet chess server, so that's always an option.",1606585959

3422,What happened to Andrei Sokolov?,chess,"Andrei Sokolov was a prominent player in the mid-80s, managing to reach the Candidates Final in 1987, where he lost to Karpov. En route, he shared first in the Candidates Tournament in Montpellier then crushed Vaganian and beat Yusupov in his Candidates matches. He first reached the top 10 in July 1986 and was ranked as high as 3rd in 1987. 

But his career swiftly declined. In 1988, less than a year after his Candidates final, his ranking had plummeted all the way to #24 and he would never return to the top 20. By 1993, he was out of the top 100. 

It seems somewhat astonishing that someone who got to such heights would become irrelevant so quickly. He was the same age as Kasparov, he was only 24 when he reached the Candidates final. And as far as I know, he had no major illnesses or forced inactivity affecting his game, it just seemed as if an elite player stopped being elite at record speed. Maybe you could argue that he was never really top 5 standard and benefitted from a purple patch, but to fall out of the top 20, top 50 and top 100 so soon?

Now, he's hardly even remembered. I would guess that if the surname Sokolov was brought up, people are more likely to think of Ivan Sokolov. 

Wonder what happened, I can't really think of an analogous situation in chess history.",1606576503

Then I remembered it was a gift from my grandfather for my first win in the french chess championship (10 years ago, I was a chess player rated \~1900 ELO).

The book is an original and was published near 1950. I didn't find this exact book on internet, only modern re-editions. It is very hard for me to determine his value.

I felt so bad to let it mold on a shelf, so I would like to do what is necessary to preserve it. And, I would like to know more about this book too. I don't plan to sell it, but can someone tell me if it has a particular value from the chess community point of view ?

All I know is that it was the last book of Henri Rinck, a French chess study composer (never heard about it), and this book is a collection of all his chess endgame studies previously published. As a player, I feel like this book is an amazing work.

3425,A game that I think is instructive,chess,"#[I have to put the GIF in a link because the rules regarding GIFs are stupid](https://imgur.com/a/eIxbyqm)

I think this game's instructive cause it shows the value of opening principles and why it's bad to move one piece over and over in the opening. This analysis is my own, not the engine's. There's a point in which black could convert to an equal position, but that didn't happen and my plan worked.

**1. e4, d5**

**2. exd5, Qxd5**

**3. Nc3, Qa5**

**4. Nf3, Bg4**

**5. Be2** I wanted to play solid and castle quickly to attack the centre.

**5... Bxf3**

**6. Bxf3, c6**

**7. O-O, Nf6**

**8. d4, e6**

**9. Bd2** Lining up the bishop and the queen to play Ne4 and possibly mess up black's kingside pawns since queenside castling was unlikely at this point.

**9... Qc7**

**10. Bg5** Still wanted to mess those pawns up.

**10... Nd5**

**11. Bxd5** With the intention of moving my knight to b5 or take away black's castling rights if 11... exd5 12Re1+ 

**11... cxd5**

**12. Nb5, Qd7**

**13. c4** Defending my knight and opening the way for my queen to go to a4, threatening nasty checks and discoveries.

**13... a6**

**14. Qa4** Because black's a pawn is pinned to the undefended rook on a8. 

**14... dxc4??** The best move was Be7, which still loses material to 15. Nc7+, Kd8 16. Qxd7+, Kxd7 17. Nxa8

**15. Nc7#**

Black's remaining minor pieces are in their original squares in the final position. If black had followed opening principles, they would have been able to defend, yet they played a lot with their queen. This allowed me to get my pieces into black's side of the board and resulted in either checkmate or being down the exchange at best.",1606574590

The other day Nepo went to the restroom very briefly. I'm not accusing him of cheating, but it made me think, what's to stop him from using his phone in there while someone quickly texts him a line?

I am not familiar with any of the regulations (besides a camera facing the players' monitors), but that one instance made me wonder how they can prevent someone from receiving engine evaluation in the bathroom or anywhere else? There could be people in the other room potentially, no?

If so, it seems like we are just playing based on the honor system, which I don't doubt that the current top players would do, but humans are humans.

Any insight on how they are controlling engine help besides having an extra camera on the player's monitor?

3469,From 1100 —-&gt; 1600 rapid in a year,chess,"This has been a great year to practice my chess skills being in quarantine and working from home. On lichess it says I have played a total of 10 days (about 240 hours) so this definitely didn’t happen overnight. My goal is to hit 2000 on lichess eventually. Here’s how my progress has gone so far: 

January: started at 1200 just like everyone else, never really played chess seriously aside from casual games with friends and family every now and then. Dropped to ~1100 after losing most of my games. Got discouraged and took a break 

Feb: realized I would need to know a few openings as I didn’t even really know how to start my games. I have learned two openings really well for black and white at this point, and haven’t found the need for more than 2 each side. For black, my go to is Sicilian defense (pawn to c5) as a lot of players like to go pawn e4 as white for their opening. As white, I use a variation of the London system. Just knowing these openings jumped my rating from 1100 to 1300 immediately. 

March-May: busy with school and didn’t play much. Was making some careless mistakes in my games, just blundering my pieces in the middle and end games. This is because my opponents always forfeit if I’m up ahead early and I never get a change to practice my mid and endgame tactics. To counter this, I started doing a lot of chess puzzles which boosted me to ~1400. 

June-August: hitting a wall, stuck at 1400 for a while.

August-November: Realized I kept running out of time in my games and that’s how I was usually losing. So, began playing a lot of blitz. It was brutal at first but eventually I just started memorizing opening sequences which saved a lot of time for the mid and endgame. When I came back to rapid, it felt like turtle speed and I never ran out of time again. I just reached 1600, but feel like I will be hitting another wall soon. 

And so that’s where I’m at, I know there’s some elite players here so I’m looking for advice on how to get from 1600 to 2000 at this point as a casual player who plays a few hours a week. Any YouTube videos you guys recommend?",1606554841

Chess evaluation computers commonly say that player is minus 3. But in reality we know that with good play on both sides that player is bound to lose. And when they lose, the computer will eventually value them at minus 20 or whatever. 

But given that that outcome was completely predictable, shouldn’t the computer value them at minus 20 or whatever from the moment they lost the minor piece? It’s not as if they made a huge series of additional blunders to go from minus 3 to minus 20. It was all baked in to the first mistake.",1606536609

This is a joke; there are situations in which the move is a good move. However, the joke is based on the reality that there are **many** situations in which the move creates a critical, exploitable weakness.

The ""[Damiano Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damiano_Defence#3.Nxe5!)"" is one such situation, in which the move f6 loses the game:

&gt; 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 3. Nxe5

White sacrifices his knight but gets more than enough in compensation.

I’ve purchased a couple chess opening books, and as I went through the first few pages, I started to wonder if “I was doing this right...”

Kg1 Qxd2...), am I supposed to follow along by imagining these moves taking place on the picture of the board or would you recommend moving the pieces on a real board in front of me as I read these moves?

**Format/Time Controls**

The Skilling Open will kick off on 22 November with sixteen players and a brand-new format. The first 9 tournaments of the Champions Chess Tour will have the same structure:

* A 3-day round-robin (16 players for each Regular event and 12 for each Major). 
* The top 8 players advance to a six-day knockout, with two days each for the quarterfinals, semi-finals and final. 

The time controls used in the Champions Chess Tour will be the same as for the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour:

* Rapid: 15'+10"" (each player has 15 minutes for all moves, with a 10-second increment after each move)
* Blitz: 5'+3""
* Armageddon: White has 5 minutes to Black’s 4, with no increments. If the game is drawn, Black wins the match.

A total of 50 Tour points are at stake in the Skilling Open (10 for finishing 1st in the preliminary rounds, and 40 for winning the final). Tour points are important since the top 8 players on the Tour will automatically be invited to the next tournament.

I heard you are suppose to memorize these and notice them in game to prevent them, but I don't really know where to be learning this. I mostly struggle with understanding what my opponent is doing and general weaknesses in the opponents board. I believe that it is because an information gap.

3649,Anyone have any clue how the super GM opening metagame works?,chess,"During the Saint Louis Rapid and Blitz tournament, as I recall a ton of people were playing the Caro Kann for some reason.

At the Skilling Open however, there's been a huge barrage of Italian Games.

Super GMs are pretty tight lipped about opening decision and preparation, but you'd have to imagine it's something they take seriously. But when Levy asked Hikaru ""so why is everyone playing the Caro Kann"" Hikaru said ""I dunno maybe they've been watching a certain chess youtuber's videos on the opening and it's negatively influenced them"" referring to Levy's videos on the opening. And that sort of answer doesn't really explain anything.

So at the Skilling Open, anyone have any clue why GMs on the opposite side of the bracket are all playing 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 suddenly?",1606447647

3658,Inventing very short games,chess,"Some years ago I liked to experiment against a weak computer, a toy really.  One game was really wild because I played black and advanced kingside pawns.  I sacrificed everything to get my King's rook to g1 mate.  It almost worked; a white knight made most of the moves to capture my Queen and other pieces while I maneuvered my rook to g1.  I was one move away when the computer captured a black piece on its home square with a pawn and promoted it to a 3rd knight, mate.  I was so shocked I did not save the game even though it only had about 12-13 moves.

A few years after that, I saw that a columnist in Chess Life asked for submissions for the ""shortest plausible game ending in underpromotion"".  It could be entirely invented, just so it was plausible.  This was interesting, but my game was lost and because one of the computer's moves was rather weak, I don't know if my lost game was even ""plausible"".

Does anyone remember what quality of invented games were submitted to Chess Life, were there any having a strategy similar to mine or were they winners for the player who invented the game?  My game was one that ended in underpromotion, but it was a game that I lost!",1606443919

Nc6  sicilians? in chessexplained's sicilian repertoire he plays an early e5, so i wonder if there's a lot of overlap with the botvinnik english.

Or is there another sicilian variation that pairs well with the English opening?",1606440662
3665,"What's the origin of these ""meta"" rules?",chess,"Hey, everyone.  I was reading the thread about the touch-move rule posted a little bit ago and it reminded me of something I've thought about ever since I started playing. It seems like the official chess rules about over-the-board behavior really try to reduce the amount of psychological warfare the players can wage against each other. Of course, they don't eliminate it, since people always talk about how intimidatingly/strangely Kasparov would act over the board. But, I think everyone can agree that there's a concerted effort to keep that kind of thing out of the game.

Where does this come from? Is it because of chess's origin as a ""gentleman's"" game?

I'm thinking of 3 rules in particular:

1) Touch-move

Many people said that the reason touch-move is a thing in chess is because of the potential for psychological warfare. Note that this rule does not exist in shogi. When this was pointed out, I saw some people worried about potential abuse.

2) No talking

Correct me if I'm wrong, but talking to your opponent about almost anything is forbidden. You can *tell* your opponent things like ""I'm adjusting this piece, not moving it,"" but any kind of over-the-board chatter is otherwise not allowed.

3) No writing down anything

This doesn't really fit with the rest because the spirit of the rule is to prevent organizing your thought on paper, not anything to do with psychological warfare, but I've heard that Bobby Fischer would write down moves on paper and gauge his opponent's reactions.

I guess my question is really ""Who decided that psychological warfare should not be a part of chess?"" This contrasts with two other over-the-board competitive games that I know of/follow: poker and Magic: the Gathering.

I don't know much about poker, but I know that talking about anything that's not the current hand is allowed. However, I've heard that these days, players are becoming less and less talkative because it puts them at too much of a disadvantage.

MtG is similar. You are allowed to talk, but most people do not, either because ~~we're socially awkward nerds~~ it doesn't give them an advantage, or ruins your own focus. Psychological warfare does exist, though, and it's a huge part of the game. Anyone who has been following competitive MtG recently (I don't blame you if you haven't, though lol) should remember LSV bluffing having no settle the wreckage by reaching for his [vampire token](https://clips.twitch.tv/HumblePatientPresidentPMSTwin?tt_content=player_twitch_logo&amp;tt_medium=clips_embed). That was a really cool play, and totally legal too.

So, to summarize, who decided chess should not involve psychological warfare? Is it because of chess's origins as a ""gentleman's"" game? Is it because it's not a hidden information game, unlike poker and MtG? Is this a good/bad thing? Or is it simply to discourage unsportsmanlike behavior?

Thanks for reading.",1606440095
3666,Can someone explain to me why this is a good move? I don’t really understand why because the pawn can just capture the knight,chess,,1606439349

3668,Origins of the Fishing Pole Trap?,chess,"Most opening traps are named after the guy who invented it, giving a rough time window of when it appeared in the chess world. The Fishing Pole Trap is an exception. Also, it’s one of the few entires on [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_traps) Wikipedia page without an article - which I want to fix. 

So, I would love to ask you whether you know...

a) who invented the trap and 

b) why it’s called Fishing Pole trap. 

My theory for b) is that the rook-queen-constellation on the long h-file reminds some people of a fishing rod, with the knight being the bait - but it’s just a theory. 

*For those who don’t know what I’m talking about: [Explanation](https://youtu.be/Qac6OFDHdTs) It’s a variant of the Ruy Lopez opening where Black sacrifices his knight on g4 in order to open the h-file for his rook - who then can support the black queen to deliver a surprising checkmate.*",1606438576

3670,Does anyone else have a problem with blundering away 'won' games,chess,"For some reason I have a problem where I blunder away games which I should win 99.9% of the time.

3722,Is studying too much “harmful” to your play?,chess,"I got laid off from my seasonal job a couple weeks ago and this have had a ton of free time, which I’ve mostly dedicated to studying chess.

I spend a few hours each day doing tactics puzzles (mostly easy ones for pattern recognition and also a good amount of harder ones for calculation). I also spend another 1-2 hours playing a classical game then analyzing it. Then maybe a couple more hours studying openings, endgames, and reading a bit or watching videos.

In the past couple weeks my lichess rating has shot up 200 points, so I feel like I’m making really good progress. However, I don’t know if more is always better in the long run. Like as someone who really enjoys working out as well, too much exercise can be a hindrance since you need time for your body to recover, so I’m not sure if the same applies to the mind/chess. I take frequent breaks throughout the day as I study chess so I don’t feel like I’m burning out.

Both players then made the recommended best moves twice, after which Giri ended up at +0.6. This felt a little antithetical to me: if Giri makes the moves that the computer think are the best, how did he lose ground?

3731,Engine-annotate top 3 move choices per move of a game for Guess The Move?,chess,"Are there any (preferably cross-platform) approaches available for having a chess engine PGN-annotate the top X strongest moves (multi-PV), for each move of a game, perhaps only for a chosen side of the board?  I've written some custom guess-the-move software for personal study, but it's structured in a way that analyzes *after* you've completed the game study completely and fed your list of guesses into it for scoring and assessment.  I'm aiming for a light-weight guess-the-move approach that I can take to physical boards offering more *realtime* feedback.  I'd prefer to not have to write more software if possible :).

I tried leveraging the lichess study interactive lesson approach to work for my needs, but it seems to lack one critical feature.  If I add a new chapter to an interactive lesson study, I can import a PGN for the chapter and have the computer analyze and annotate the game, which at least provides a barebone assessment.  Problem is, if you go into preview mode now to play along as the winner in a guess-the-move like approach, the study only accepts the main-line moves (even if the engine actually determined the player made a mistake, or that there was a stronger move).  I was hoping it would indicate I made a good move choice, but then take me back to the main line to continue studying the game.  

Any recommendations out there?  Would be just as happy if I could feed a raw PGN in, and out burped the same PGN, with annotations for every white move (as an example), indicating top 3 strongest choices.  This feels like a usable approach for across a real board.",1606409463

Normal Modern Scandi

1. e4 d5
2. exd5 Nf6 
3. d4 Nxd5
4. c4 Nb6



Ideas/plans for Black:


—fianchetto Bishop on g7 like a King's Indian. Castle.


—White will try to get center pawns in c4 and d4.



—Play Nc6, followed by an immediate e5! Don't support with Re8, it's too slow. Attack the center now.


—Nc6 entices White to push d5. Retreat to Ne7.


—Push f5. If all goes according to plan, you should have center pawns at f5 and e5. Can now push f4 or e4, depending on the position.




The problem:


I've tried playing this in blitz, but White Knight gets to g5. Before I can setup the f5 e5 pawns, Ne6 infiltrates my position. I can't remember if I'm supposed to stop this, and I can't find the video anymore.

So for a couple of weeks now every night when I close my eyes a chess game starts playing. It doesn’t stop, it really really bothers me. I also get the feeling of playing chess too. That competitive focus, and I wake up like 20 times throughout the night.  It’s very very uncomfortable and lonely and terrifying. It feels like my brain is just playing chess nonstop in the background and I have no control over it. My dreams all involve chess. Sometimes I have a dream about something else but the feeling of playing chess is still present. Like A suspicious feeling that someone is going to take my queen for example.

3906,Tips for more consistent defense as black?,chess,"As white, I started as a d4 player for a while but I realized d5 and then Ruy Lopez to trade my bishop for a knight to worsen black's pawn structure has been going really well for me as it forces a lot of moves from the opponent and I am more experienced at it than most of my opponents (my rating is still kinda low).

3923,Best way to improve strategic play?,chess,"Hey, so right now I'm almost 1500 on lichess been playing on and off since quarantine began. I improved my tactic vision and now I'm pretty good at finding them in game. I find that my biggest problem is not tactical, but strategic play. In some games, I just find myself always playing what looks to me like ""the best move"", but usually it doesn't come with a very good plan in mind, and watching good players, they always move with some sort of plan. One example for this is I sometimes have an option to develop my bishop to multiple suqares, and I'm never sure which one to choose, and I know it does matter which square it is developed to, because each square I put it in should come with a different plan. 

Anyways what I'm saying is that when it comes to middle game, I tend to look for tactics, but if my opponent plays the opening correctly I'm pretty much post as to what to do next, as I just can't find the next move. What is a good tool to study about this?",1605859001

If they lose on time during those 30 seconds they lose the game. After 30 seconds, the clocks will be paused and then resumed as soon as possible after the player reconnects. The aim is to ensure, as far as possible, that chess skills and not internet connections decide results, while also avoiding situations where a game is frozen for too long in a time scramble. ""

3955,Had an idea for a chess variant,chess,"What if you played a game of chess with three people with a regular board, but with three people. Each player would rotate positions in a circle. The object of the game would not to win for one side or the other, but to be the person who delivers checkmate, for either side. You play two moves for each side before switching. One position consists of waiting while the other two players play. If your turn is a check you can play another move. Whoever is playing the opposite color when the check occurs defends.  All other rules apply. 

I was thinking about what strategies might emerge, and so I thought about what the Nash equilibrium would look like. I'm guessing, you would be incentivized to play fairly for both sides. Any weaknesses that may appear from your moves may be exploited by the other two players. So, say, for your turn you decide to sac one of white's pieces for no compensation. The weaknesses therein sustained would cause your opponents to have an opportunity to achieve a checkmating sequence. Attacking would be met with defending. If you did not defend attacks, you could lose, or weaken the position to the point of being exploitable by another player. ""Resigning"" is not really an option, as the game is up for grabs until someone wins, or there is a draw. I think draws will be less common because of the weaknesses and imperfect play that comes from not being tied down to either side. I'm not sure if attacking would be incentivized, though. If it's not then the game might be even more drawish than regular chess. 

If this breaks any rules, I'll delete it. it was just fun to think about. Wanted to know what other people think about it as a game. If it would be fun or not.",1605842732

So in episode 5, at around 22:20, Beth is playing the guy that was over at her house to coach her, and the board looks like this

https://imgur.com/a/k7lU0CT

At which point, she plays Nh8, and claims that it is a deceptively good move. After Nxh8 she plays c4, saying that it ""unlocks the bishop"". He, understandably to me, says ""what about the other bishop?"" pointing to her B file bishop, implying that his rook can just take. She says ""for christ sake, it will be check once the pawn moves and the knight trades"".

I've been trying to figure out which pawn white would move here rather than protecting the queen, and what she means by trading the knight. To me, it just looks like white is plain losing after Rxb1.

3966,An interesting improvement to the basic rules of chess,chess,"I believe that a king should be able to move into the scope of a piece that is pinned to the opponents king.

When you think about it the whole point of a check is to show that there is a threat against the king that you need to respond to, and that your king in a theoretical sense will be 'captured' next move. 
So your king can't move into check but if a piece is pinned there is no threat. 

I think this could add alot of interesting tactics. Consider this position. White: kh5, bh4. Black rook h1 king g2.
You could play king g3 in this position going into the scope of the pinned bishop to pick it up with rxh4 next move.

Why do you think this is not a part of the basic rules of chess? Are there weird situations where this would break the game or be unoptimal?",1605837270

Basically, I kept using chess apps that were messing with the levels of the Stockfish engine, and I found that it really wasn't translating to better play. So, I started following a bunch of chess streams, video lectures, and so on, and still wasn't seeing much improvement. It was the educational materials for chess, though, that really caught my attention, since the methods used are very similar to the bad methods used to teach foreign languages. So, drawing a few analogies (e.g., treating the material as the lexicon, the board state as the permissible syntax, good moves as grammatical input, etc.), I thought about approaching my practice to fit more what SLA studies recommend.

So, I broke down the game into 108 levels, basically 54 possible combinations starting from the opponent spotting everything but the pawns, to a standard game, times 2 to include both states with white opponents and with black opponents. I then used Stockfish 11 (level 20) to repeatedly rank the board states, and then ordered those states accordingly.

Then, I built a chess GUI that gives a color-based, rather than numerical, indication of one's winning or losing stance. If you're winning more than losing, the black squares appear bluer. Conversely, if you're losing more than winning, the black squares appear redder. I then denied myself software features that make cheating the engine easy -- move recommendations, for example. I really wanted to reinforce the feel of human-to-human play, where it's just your mind at work, without the meta-analysis on top of it (that's what chess commentary's for).

It's available now on Windows, and I'll be publishing an Android version on Google Play soon-ish.

For those worried about security, data collection, etc., the app doesn't connect to the Internet, at all. I might update SpotChess to allow users to open FEN's and PGN's on major sites like Lichess.org or Chess.com, but what I prioritize will depend on user feedback.

\- 1961 Soviet Chess Championship Baku Chess set

We all know how playing chess for long periods of time is *exhausting*. Combining that with the place being airconditioned, me being hungry, and also nervous, I messed up big time.

I could've won. But nope. My opponent cheated, and I failed to notice.

This jerk (he was younger than me, probably 9 or 10) just pretended to make a move? Like, I'm still frusrated by it. He lifted the piece, swung it around as if he was thinking where to place it, and brought it back to its original spot. He then pressed the clock and what did I do? I didn't notice; I continued to play. This cost me the game because it was a **ZUGZWANG**. . .

I have been using chess tempo for tactics, just doing the standard ones. Over the last six months I've steadily climbed to 1800. Over the same amount of time I've climbed to the high 1500s on Lichess but cracking 1600 is very hard. 

I have had setbacks along the way, occasionally dropping 30-50 ratings points, but I've always regained them pretty quickly. I usually just need to be more patient and less confident.

On reaching 1800 I wavered around it for a bit, getting a few right, and a few wrong, and then just took an absolute beating back down to 1740.

Dailies on the other hand can be way too slow and sometimes I forget what was even happening without looking through the move history. 

playing the Computer is nice because they are flexible. If something IRL comes up or its a tough position, no problem you won't run out of time. CPU is ready when you are; fast or slow play.

4088,Advice about chess tournaments [LONG],chess,"Hello.

I have written about this topic many, many, many times on this account.
It really means a lot to me.
What's my problem?
Well...

I have started playing chess (that means in a club, and in local tournaments; also it means that I have started getting ""serious"" about studying it) about 2 years ago at the age of 13 (approx). At the start, I didn't have huge dreams or anything, just liked playing it. From the end of 2018 up to start of 2020, my interest in chess and my strenght grew rapidly. In february this year I switched to a much better club with some very good kids and some great coaches. As my strenght grew, my ""dreams"" did too.
As I don't want you guys to fall asleep reading this, I will try to get straight to the point.

At some point on life, I want to become a strong player.
That doesn't mean a fine club player, I want to become ""at least"" something like an FM or IM. What is one of the requirements to become, let's say, a fide master (in this case the only)? 

Welp, it's 2300 fide rating. 
 
How do you gain rating?

By playing many tournament games.


I hope you guys know where this is going...

In the part of the world where I live (western Croatia, Google it if you want) there are not many tournament where I can gain rating, experience and after all, at least enjoy  playing the game. But now this virus destroyed even  my last hopes. In the biggest close city (I de facto live there- some 20 km from the city centre ) there are at most 2 ""big"" open tournaments---&gt; at most 40ish players with most of them below 2000, maybe 2 titled players.
 
Also, I should add this:
Although my fide rating is just a little below 1500, I and my coach both  know that my actual strenght is much higher; my estimation is somewhere around 1900-1950.

I feel kind of sad that as it seems, I will never reach my actual strenght.


1.
So please, I anyone lives in my region (Croatia, Slovenia , Bosnia, northern Italy, maybe but hardly some patrs of Austria, germany, hungary, Serbia...) please give me some info if there are some good tournaments in your surrounding area.

 2.
How to manage money and time?

Going to tournaments costs.
What are some good ways to make money for tournaments and similar stuff?
My family is financially very stable, but it's not like we're rich or anything. We can afford maybe some tournaments, but nothing major really. Also, my parents work kinds of jobs where they don't get too much spare time. My dad is a co-founder of a small local company, so he can every now and then take  few days off to travel with me, but he can't do it too often.

Last thing to add...

If the situation calms down a bit in 2021, I should have around 35-45 fide rated games, at most.
Some optimal number of yearly games should probably be around 60, maybe 70 games.

I really hope some of you have got at least some advice for me, this situation really makes me feel a bit sad.

Thanks in advance, I really appreciate every small piece of advice :)",1605390608

I have 2 weeks to prepare and could really use some advice.

I am rated about 1750 on both blitz and rapid on chess.com, and i have signed up for the unrated and under 2000 section. If my chess.com rating is anything like a uscf rating, that means i will be a strong contender in this tournament. (I hope)

The problem is, they are 90 minute games. With 15 second increments. 

I have NEVER played a competetive chess game that wasnt over 30 minutes. I will enjoy the occasional rapid game on chess.com, and the time control feels all but sluggish to a blitz-addict like me. 

I am very worried that i will rush my move in the opening, and then suffer a slightly worse position in the middlegame that my opponents can capitalize on.

Another problem is, my playing style is very aggresive. I love playing gambits and sacrificing pawns and pieces for activity. My opening repertoire is like 75 percent gambits. Seriously.

Kings gambit, budapest, benko, scotch gambit, icelandic gambit, and of course the evans gambit just to name the ones i like the most.

In these longer time controls its arguably easier for opponents to think of ways to bank the extra pawn and defend from my not-always-precise sacrifices.

My main question is- should i stick to the style i know best, or should i try to stick to more solid openings and a more reserved middlegame playstyle?

My other question is- what should i do to prepare? Grind out opening prep? Study my endgame? Please help!",1605381152

I don't know why but I get terrible anxiety playing other people ranked. unranked is fine, probably cause it doesn't ""matter"", but I'd like to get over it and get better at the game. I find its the worst in a difficult position where I'm not sure where to move. I'll move and then look at my rank, then at the board, rinse repeat 2 or 3 times. Its also bad playing daily games cause I feel like I check my email constantly to see if they moved yet.

I recently came across some scanned pages of two chess books I had borrowed from my library about 15 years ago.

However, I did not make note of what the titles were, and as it has been so long I am not sure what they were called.

The book with photos of famous players seems to discuss games up to 1984, doesn't mention Kasparov being world champion, and talks about Karpov having successfully defended his title, which may suggest the age of the book. It is probably around 200 pages.

The other book with drawings of various chess positions seems to be for complete beginners and is perhaps quite small in length. It uses the ""re"" spelling of centre, which may also indicate where it was published.

Does anyone recognise the books in these pictures? I'd greatly appreciate any of your guesses.

Should one still say good game or should one acknowledge that the game was far from good? And I don't mean mock or berate the other player, but simply saying thanks for the game instead of saying good game. Has it happened to you? What do you think is appropriate?

Me personally, while I know that saying ""Good game"" is usually something the player does mechanically after every game, it still bother me when I play an awful game and the opponent declares ""good game well played"" when obviously I was having the opposite of that. It feels like I'm being made fun of, especially online when I can't read the tone of the other player. And when I'm facing someone clearly having a bad game I simply thank them afterwards.

In both tournaments and online games there was about a 10% difference on a pretty large sample size. Also other people's stats just looking through it when the male and female are roughly similarly rated 3. A study was done FIDE games all games where women played men and women exceeded expectations compared to men in the games they played against each other which is a huge sample size. 
Given that in reality the absolute vast majority of chess players are males we aren't able to notice this but these facts lead to me firmly believing that if a lot of females played chess there would overall be more too female players than male players.",1605291846

Biden, you are white. Trump, you are black.

Trump: I don't want to be black. I only want to be white. And the drawing was rigged against me. By China.

Biden: Ok, Trump, you can have white. It's not a big deal. Not worth fighting over.

Moves begin (Trump as white, Biden as black):

**1. f3** (Trump thinks: ""He'll never have seen this coming. I don't do things by convention.""**e6** (Biden: ""Let's play it safe and cautious."")

\*Trump tries to promote a pawn into a queen\* (Trump: ""Ima get myself another woman!"")

Arbiter: ""Sir, that is not a legal move.""

Trump: ""I get to make the rules. It's my ~~dictatorial~~ executive right.""

Arbiter: ""Sorry, that's not how it goes.""

Trump then plays:

**2. g4** (Trump: ""Fine. All out war fuled by covfefe!"")**Qh4#**

Arbiter: ""0-1. Biden has won. Please sign the scoresheets.""

Trump: I refuse to sign. The result was stolen from me. Biden cheated. These results are not certifiable.

Arbiter: Chess is a perfect information game. Your claim is factually and patently false.  The Secret Service has already swept and cleared the room for bugs and communication devices.

Biden: Actually, it was a pretty simple, and straightforward play. Do you really think I could have remembered and prepared a longer line?

Trump: There is no way I could have lost without Biden cheating.

Biden: I just studied and took the game seriously.

Trump: Oh yeah, then what is the name of that mate you just played? Do you even remember playing that mate?

Can anyone recommend any chess puzzles with relatively few/well-spaced pieces?",chess,"(Apologies in advance because I know this is a strange question, and my limited knowledge of chess makes it hard for me to gauge the feasibility of this request or even if the question makes much sense.)

I usually make crossword puzzles for my father for his birthday and this year I'd like to do a chess-themed one, since he's a longtime fan of the game and we just watched Queen's Gambit together.  I'd really like to do a somewhat literal puzzle (ideally a set of puzzles, since 8x8 is quite small) where the squares represent squares on a chessboard and the position of a given piece is represented by a rebus with the name of that piece (mockup in the picture).  My current idea is to have kind of a double puzzle, where the crossword represents a board that has its own chess puzzle, and the title could be something like ""Mate in Two"", e.g., and you would have to solve both the crossword and the chess puzzle.  (Obviously I'd have to find some way of distinguishing white from black pieces, but I could shade the squares or something like that.)

I like this idea but I'm not sure how realistic it is.  I can find a lot of chess puzzles searching online, but in terms of ones I could use, there are a lot of restrictions imposed by the crossword format.  For instance, I can't have pieces that are next to each other or even really very close to each other (horizontally), because it would be extremely hard to find acceptable fill that contains the names of two pieces.  Also, any more than 5 pieces total (maybe 6, but that's pushing it) would be very difficult to fill around.

Does what I'm looking for exist?  If so, could anyone recommend any specific puzzles, or advise me on how to search more effectively?",1605284289

4299,positional player questions,chess,"Hi, i started out by getting to 1000 on rapid, and I did that by playing the london. I'm starting to not like the london anymore, and I felt like i just need to grind a large frequency of games, so I've switched to playing the ruy lopez on blitz (5 mins). The players seem to be more sharper and more accurate moves on blitz. My blitz rating climbing slowly from 700. 

The way I describe my playstyle is I'm less material focused and more position focused- im more than willing to give up minor pieces if it opens up the board in a favorable way, especially if the position it opens up is towards the enemy king. for example one of the things i learned from the london is using exchanges to open up the board, i really like the london variation where you retreat an attacked bishop to g3, opening up an exchange that makes it so you take back with a pawn, opening up your rook completely. 

I've picked up the ruy lopez and always go for the exchange variation. I like the positional advantage I get by creating both doubled pawns and a castle opportunity right off the bat. I've heard that ruy lopez is a bit more of an advanced opening, but ive not really ran into big problems with it yet. 

so ive got some questions:

1.  is there an opening for white that my playstyle is most suited for. I'm very new so I don't know much chess history but from what I've heard about his moves i feel like i wanna play like Paul Morphy. Is it worth studying him and using his openings?

2. Good openigs for black with my playstyle? I've never really developed an opening for black, I've always just developed reactively. I've dabbled in the scandinavian, but I just feel lost in that opening.

3. One thing i noticed is that sometimes my accuracy can be quite low. I look into analysis, and things like a greek gift when the king is trapped by his major pieces and I still have my queen and other pieces near his king, analysis puts it at a blunder to give up the bishop but open up his position. Should I be worried about accuracy at all? I looked at very high rated players and they consistently have like 90+ accuracy.

4. Finally I was just wondering about chess books. How are you supposed to properly read these? are you supposed to be ""fluent"" on your chess vision and be able to visualize the lines that are talked about, or is it typical to map them all out on a board?

4344,Stop giving toxic advise like ‘dont hang your pieces’,chess,"There are a lot of people posting questions like : I am 1350 on lichess and I want to improve. I know this post is of mediocre quality at best. (see below)

There are always a few people who respond like : if you don’t hang your pieces , you will get rating 2000 easily. Let’s assume for ease of argument we are talking about 1500FIDE. 

I am getting really annoyed by those comments. 

Reason 1: it is incorrect. Yes, chess games are won and lost by tactics in most games especially in shorter time controls and lower rated players. But if I literally follow the advise by playing moves like 1. a3 and 2. h3 (which has the least probability for giving away pieces) I will get in trouble. So there’s are already two instructions: play active and don’t give away pieces  and that is the difficulty. In your brains you are looking at getting active pieces and you miss a hanging piece. 

Reason 2: Not giving away pieces is a too simplified expression. Most losses are caused by tactics (like in puzzle rush) and tactics can be very complicated. Tactics can be trained in a structural way. If you train them by type , you will learn to recognize the pattern. When you recognize the pattern , you are able to see the pattern on the board. When you see the pattern, you can prevent it and become a better player. 

Also; the player with the better positional structure and more control over the board wins the game. Simply because it is more difficult to find a good move when your position is cramped. And in the end after you finally find one, it blunders a piece. 

Reason 3: I have never ever seen someone who was able to change his thought process by telling you this. It is like: I struggle playing the Berlin Defense of the Ruy Lopez and 
someone replies with remember all the moves. It is freaking useless. 


Reason 4: it sounds like a beginners instruction although at least 30 % of the regular chess club players struggle with this. It claims a superiority you don’t have. It shows desinterest in people. For me, it sounds like:
“the only thing you should do is follow one simple instruction: don’t give away your pieces. When you stop doing that you are allowed to ask questions again, because there is where the real chess begins.” 

You are just as a scrub like me, you and every other chess player in the world. 

We all know many chess members on our chess club who play every week for at least 20 years and still give away pieces. 


Reason 5: we are all a combination of a few factors who determine our chess strength. I will sum a few up ( and there are more), opening knowledge, endgame knowledge, tactics, strategy , consistency, mentality, aggressiveness. And it could be possible you will get to rating x by only learning every single move in every opening book.  Although technically correct, it might be less fun. 

Please all, read the question as I am 1350 and want to become better at chess. I have never studied chess, I don’t understand your lingo and I have no single clue. Where can I learn more. 

ASK questions, refer them to good sources you liked. And acknowledge that chess is sometimes a difficult game. And sometimes you make stupid mistakes.",1605227370

4349,Why don't GM's ever hang pieces?,chess,"Sure maybe 1 game in a million they will hang a piece under time pressure or something but let's be honest it essentially happens zero times in classical chess. 


However I'm 1600 rated on chess in rapid and I hang a piece probably once every 3 or 4 games. Not to a tactic or a fork I mean just straight up move a piece to a square where it can be freely taken with no consequence. I don't understand why this happens because I scan the board for a minute or two and then make my move but I fail to see the square I'm moving it to is directly under attack? Why is this? 


If I could go back in time and observe myself playing the move I'm pretty sure I would see the square is attacked but in the game I can't see it? I don't accept ""I just didn't realise"" as a viable excuse. I'm been driving a car for 8 years and I've never run down a person because ""I just didn't realise"" they were in the middle of the damn road...

Nc3` black *could* take the bishop with `5. .. Qxf4` which looks like winning material but actually black loses the rook now.

    5. Nc3 Qxf4 6. Nd5

Now black's queen is attacked and has to move. But `Nd5` threatens a to fork the rook with check on `c7`.
Black has to move the queen but it can't defend that square. The engine suggests `6. .. Qe4` and white will take the rook.

4406,(New player) Trying to understand a resignation in this game,chess,"*Disclaimer: First post on this subreddit, so I hope it's according to the rules. If not, please let me know and I'll fix it.*

I've recently picked up chess again after a few years and decided to hit the ground running with Irving Chernev's Logical Chess; move by move. In order to get a better understanding of the game, I try to play out the variations and sequences mentioned on a physical board. By no means do I understand every step of the way but I felt like I was getting somewhere until the end of game 15: Alekhine - Poindle from Vienna 1936. I've shown the state of the board below:

[Turn 29: White has just played Nd6, Black to move](https://preview.redd.it/dbjlxftrfty51.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d042b131e38e48bcac250d01f0c1f9b658e3e1d1)

The only context given for 29. ...  Rd8 is that going Rxe2 instead would instantly result in mate with Qf7# (which makes total sense), but what is so positive about Rd8? The only thing I see is that emptying h8 gives the king an extra space it could move to, but wouldn't Rf8 also provide that freedom whilst also providing cover against Qf7 in case the rook on e6 would get 'misplaced' in later turns?  


So the game continues with 29. ... Rd8 30. Kf1 and then Black resigns. Chernev points out that ( with 31. Nxc8 Rxc8 32. Qxd7+) Black is very likely to lose a rook or two. His last comment on this game is ""There is no fight left"", but i don't see why this would be the case. Black would still have a move before the listed sequence is played out, so why not go for 30. ... Re7? It wouldn't prevent the possibility  of a bishop-knight exchange on c4, but would stop the scenario Chernev described as cause of the resignation?  


I've been trying multiple sequences with both the 'options' mentioned above and I don't see why it wouldn't be worth it to keep going. What am I not seeing here, is it that impossible/worthless to continue? I'm not pretending to be a genius here, I just want to understand the reasoning behind the resignation by Black.

4433,Pam-Krabbé Castling,chess,"Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/jsnukd/who_advocated_for_no_castling_when_in_check_as_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) thread, where the history of castling or the ""no castling when in check""-rule was discussed i want to share some further interesting knowledge about castling with you.

According to the former (FIDE) rules, castling was allowed when:

1. Neither the King nor the Knight have been moved
2. There is no other piece between the King and the Knight
3. No enemy piece is attacking a square over which the king moves
4. The king is not in check before or after castling

So it was the danish chess composer C. Staugaard who came up with the idea, that there might be another way of castling and he published following chess problem in the Skakbladet chess magazine in November 1907:

&amp;#x200B;

[C. Staugaard: White to play, mate in 2](https://preview.redd.it/uvhi0xoyrry51.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5212df45efb27c1b2e9e8c48f4f5269ba6816407)

The idea behind this chess problem is simple but brilliant: 

If white plays **e7–e8R!** the Rouge on e8 is a new piece on the board which has not yet moved. Also there is no other piece between the white Knight and the King, nor is any enemy piece attacking any square on the e-line. But most important, no where in the rules was stated that castling had to be done horizontally, to the King's or the Queen's side. So the idea if **vertical castling** was born and the solution to the chess problem is:

**1. e7–e8R! Kd3xc2 2. 0–0–0–0#**

&amp;#x200B;

[Final position of the chess problem](https://preview.redd.it/ku8ze3whvry51.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e25e4bc04424c3613b0e4ab9c2b1f3100c94933)

As you can see from the image above the King is also not in check before and after castling so vertical castling was legal according to the 4 former (FIDE) Rules or within the definition.

Even though this was discovered in 1907 and it was an formally legal chess move the majority of the chess community was not aware of this possibility. It was the french Grandmaster Jean-Luc Seret who set the hare running when he published in 1971 in the Europe-Echecs magazine following composition, which was meant to be a April's fool joke:

 

[White mates in 2](https://preview.redd.it/pdd9atgmxry51.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72663540396dba228d4a3fae971e261019e83582)

The solution of this chess problem is: **1. e7–e8R! Kh1xg1 2. 0–0–0–0#**

&amp;#x200B;

Finally Max Pam and Tim Krabbé seized the idea and published the following chess problem in the Schaakbulletin magazine in 1972:

&amp;#x200B;

[White mates in 2](https://preview.redd.it/exqldni1zry51.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17c6abd13daf9c2789d278e46449644cd16af62f)

Again the solution of the problem is: **1. e7–e8R!** **Kf3-g2** **2. 0–0–0–0#**

Even though there were earlier publications about this move (also some publications i did not mention), it was named after Max Pam and Tim Krabbé: **Pam-Krabbé Castling**.

After it was made public and some debate in numerous chess columns FIDE then revised its rules to refer to a rook “on the same rank.”",1605172608

After watching Queen's Gambit (which is fucking amazing btw) I have a nostalgia for something I've never experienced, as a relatively new player. That something is game analysis without engines. I feel like it used to be a HUGE part of people growing up as chess players. There is a scene in the series in which Beth is hype about finding an error in a Morphy game, which is fascinating, because now I could just plug the game into an engine and have most of the work done for me and I just need to interpret the engine lines.

My two questions are

1) Am I just misguided on how useful engine analysis is?

4503,A fun idea: chess pong,chess,"I randomly had an idea for a new hybrid 'sport' that combines chess and tabletennis, inspired by chess-boxing. You could substitute table-tennis for other point-scoring sports but it's just a convenient example that juxtaposes mental dexterity with physical dexterity.

The basic idea is this: Every time a player wants to capture a piece, both players have to play a point (or a best of 3 points or whatever) of tabletennis. If the taking player wins the point, they 'convert' the capture successfully. However, if they don't win the point, they must return the capturing piece back to its original square and play a different move. 

I think it would change the way the chess is played in a huge way, since you have to hedge your tactics on the probability that you lose the table-tennis point. But that's kind of interesting too because it creates more flashpoints of tension where the outcome isn't predetermined, just like real-life battles. 

Another possible consequence is that we can declare the game to end when the king is taken, not just on checkmate. Even if the attacking player achieves checkmate, they must 'convert' it into a win, while the defending player can try to stave it off or try to implement their own attack. This might also eliminate stalemates, since you can risk walking into the line of fire with your king.

Anyway I haven't playtested it at all but I think it's a fun idea. What do you guys think?",1605129945

4516,Book Advice,chess,"I'm new to this sub so if this post isn't allowed please delete.

I've played chess since I was a kid but never took it seriously, I just played to play. I know how all the pieces move and know all the basics needed to play a game, like en passant and castling. I know of the concept of openings, middlegame and endgame but don't know the details. I want to improve my game and am looking for suggestions on books to read or any kind of guide on how to improve my game in an efficient way. I saw the FAQ suggested ""The Game of Chess"" by Siegbert Tarrasch. Is this a good place to start for someone in my place? I know the best way to get better is to practice but I feel like when I play, I'm playing without structure and just trying to get to the end instead of thinking about setups and control of the board.

4519,Reviving Chess in my Community.,chess,"I'm currently a 2100 high schooler looking to revive chess in my community (for elementary school students). I'm from a pretty small area, but when I was in 4th- 6th grade, my school was placing really high in National Elementary School tournaments. Since then, there hasn't been a single player in elementary school above about 1100 in the whole state. I've been trying to contact my old elementary school's very new coach (the old one just recently moved) for creating weekly meetings for chess clubs, however he will only do once per month. What used to be a 50-60 kid chess club is now turning into about 5-6 kids playing in a 2 round chess tournament on chesskid. 

I've thought about maybe trying to work with my state director to create online rated tournaments? I've never directed a tournament and am not sure on how to get the training needed to do so. So, any suggestions for that would be great!

I will do whatever it takes if it means i can trounce these 600 to 700 flaggers who win once and run.

I thought grinding lots of games would help. But nothing i can find helps in that akward late midgane phase where sides have no structure 

From there ill hang pieces and i just dont see the full board. Even when up i end up defending as i try abd pick them off piece by piece u til i have pieces vs a king rather than just using extra pieces to checkmate.

I hate that i cant do it. Ill do whatever i need to improve fast. Just tell me what. Will getting a coach help? If i paid for coaching how fast can i improve?

I'm not that good, after 1000 games I'm like 1485 in 5 min blitz and 1676 in Rapid 10 minutes. 

I like the game so I've started reading some books and watching some videos.

After some tests I'm ending with 1 opening I like for white that is the Stonewall Attack and 2 opening for black that are Sicilian defense or Indian game. I would like to add something more opening on my white repertoire cause using always the Stonewall Attack is a little boring. What could be a good idea ?

Anyway, I thought why this was such a bad move was interesting and non intuitive.  The problem with this move is it allows white to play h4 and then Bg5, and this just really hampers blacks development.  Really, there was no need to fianchetto my bishop, as f8-a3 diagonal was already open, and i could have just played Bc5, double attacking the knight and developing my bishop.  If we can give some problems to our opponent while at the same time accomplishing our goals this is better than just giving them free reign.",1605111506

4562,Still possible to achieve a GM title (FIDE),chess,"Hi guys, so some background, I was introduced to chess.amd taught how to play the basics (move pieces) by my mother when I was 7 and I played on and off until a few months ago back in August. I mastered all the must know  basics (moving pieces,Castling,En Passant, promotion) and got the hang of basic tactics like forks and pins relatively quickly and from that point started playing chess more often. This past month (since late October) I've ramped up my playing to at least an hour a day of play with at least 1 extra hour of study. I've been doing on minimum 10 lichess puzzles a day, and at least 3 matches on rapid (all time controls lichess) .

But I would like to achieve GM someday and I'm wondering if I'm already too old (Just hit 14 a month back), in addition I have a few questions if you would take the time out of your day to answer them , I would be most grateful.

1. Should I play more matches with online randoms or continue playing with more experienced friends instead? 

2. Good chess books recommendation 

3. Best openings to memorise for reply to 1.e4. (Currently trying to learn Sicilian Dragon for that but open to reco)

4. Recommended openings? ( I currently play QG for white or London if opponent plays nf6, and KID for black. Though idk how to counter 1.e4 properly)

5. Lichess vs Chess.com (Pros/Cons) 

6. Recommendations for further progression.

4569,"To those who have played other abstracts, what brings you back to chess?",chess,"I'm specifically thinking about the game Go (Baduk/Weiqi), which seems to always be up for comparison to chess as two of the best known -- and oldest -- abstracts that are still played today. Although any other abstracts you've played are up for discussion, as well.

I often see discussions about Go and chess from the lens of Go players who used to play chess but now prefer Go. For anyone who has read the numerous articles comparing these two games, the answers are usually pretty common: Go has more depth, Go is more ""simplistic"" in its rules, it's more elegant, it's more beautiful, etc. (I'm not saying these opinions are necessarily true, but it's what most commonly gets brought up in comparative discussions if you do a little digging).

But I see fewer discussions from chess players who have tried Go but decided to still stick with chess. So I'm curious for those who have tested the waters with Go (or really any abstracts) but still mainly play chess.

Preemptive edit 1: obviously people can enjoy and play multiple abstracts over the course of their life; I'm just wondering about players who have tried out other abstracts and thought, ""meh, I still prefer chess.""

Preemptive edit 2: This is not meant to provoke a pissing competition between chess and Go. As an amateur player of both, I think both are beautiful in different ways, and both take different skillsets to become proficient (i.e. Go players are not somehow more intelligent than chess players merely because Go has more possible moves, etc.). I just think different minds are attracted to different things.",1605108053

4615,Looking for advice on how to improve/learn basic chess fundamentals,chess,"I have picked up playing chess online over the past few months and feel like I’m at a personal plateau (rating is about 800). So far I’ve just been learning through some basic YouTube videos on openings and playing puzzle rush. I’m looking for suggestions on books/articles/videos that could help me push through this plateau.

4616,"Regarding the difference in skill between the best female and male chess players, why is it so hard to believe that the best men are simply better because genetically the y-chromosome is linked to greater deviations in mutations and anomalies?",chess,"Yes I have read all of the articles about the history of chess, barriers women face, society and culture's role, the fact that less women are into chess at a competitive level, etc. 

However everyone always ignores the fact that deviations which cause outliers to begin with are greater in men due to the presence of the y-chromosome.

For example in athletics, if a male and female both exhibit some extraordinary ability to eliminate substrate from their muscles, the male will deviate more greatly than the female from the norm. And this is consistent across the board with individuals having abnormal strength, more explosiveness, etc. 

In chess for example, when we look at someone such as Carlsen, it's evident that there is something to his thought process that simply can't be learned by the average player. Likewise this is also evident in many top players, both male and female. 

So why is it so hard to believe that the deviation in his abnormal cognitive ability simply isn't greater than that of women's due to him being male? 

And no, no one is saying the best players don't study hard and practice hard, but you're an idiot if you think your average Joe can become the world chess champion just through studying and practicing chest all the time. 

Think of the y-chromosome as a multiplier, if an individual inherits a gift then for females it will be expressed to a certain level, but for males it will be expressed to a certain level and then also multiplied.",1605067007
4617,A CALLOUT - Hanging Pawns,chess,"One of my favourite YTubers is an Australian named Marcus. He made some videos were he called people out for BS. In this post I will be calling out the YT channel called Hanging Pawns (referred to as HP from here)  


In light of posts such as this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/jrbajq/can\_we\_get\_some\_love\_for\_hangingpawns\_the\_chess/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/jrbajq/can_we_get_some_love_for_hangingpawns_the_chess/) where people want to heap praise on somebody, I am going to do the opposite. Now....before continuing, I have nothing personal against the dude, he seems like a nice guy. However....the fact of the matter is there are plenty, yes plenty of seriously good content creators (from the top of my head people like Andras Toth) that get almost no love and seriously low viewer counts while others pump out slightly pretentious content (imo) and get nothing but praise and love. Lets set the matter a little straight. This is partly motivated by the spot on analysis by /u/tylercruz "" however I think it might be beneficial for him to act more as a student rather than a teacher ""  


We could go a little deeper but for this topic I've chosen the latest video from said channel, see here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=169TljBWDCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=169TljBWDCM) ( please click the video and watch it. I am not trying to deter views, I just want to keep things real!)  


His video is supposed to be a ""refutation"" of the Latvian gambit. Lets have a look.  


0:00 He goes on a cute story about how he has struggled vs the Latvian vs a friend of his, the Latvian is basically one of the shittiest openings possible for black in 1.e4 e5 and meanwhile our ""authority"" (teacher vs student!) struggles heavily with this.  


01:37 The subject is so easy that it will ""take exactly 10 minutes, I don't think you need more time....."" - The video N.B. is over 16 minutes.  


03:00 some stuff about him playing exf5 and failing, fair enough. I don't feel he has much knowledge about this line but what he says seems to check out decently...don't let the start fool you though!  


04:35 he looks at 3.exf5 e4 4.Nd4 claims Nd4 is the best move after 3.exf5 but ""still sub-optimal vs the line I am going to show you"" ....it's noteworthy at this point, Stockfish 12 gives +1.85 for white at depth 30 and  I am barely bothering with the computer....just to show you the ""depth"" of the creators ""research""  


04:44 he goes on with the line... ""and black can play ...c5 here"" and goes down a relatively forced line where according to him ""black gets a ton of play"" .....""...but black's pieces are active"" which seems strange with Stockfish 12 giving white's top 3 moves at depth 30: +2.73, +1.97 and +1.91 .  N.B: black's pieces are ""active"" with ONE knight out and white with two pieces out and ready to castle. The simple 9.0-0 is the 3rd best move but gives white an easy and pleasant edge with an extra pawn, more pieces out, better king and Re1+ coming.  


05:09 ""let me give you the BEST move for white in this position"" .....PAY ATTENTION! This happens a lot with this and other lower level creators. They look at the engine for like 5-10 seconds and then make a claim like it means something. At depth 32 ( I can't be bothered to go further but still miles further than your favourite creator)  9.Bg5 is +2.99 almost 1.5 pawns higher than 9.g4 (+1.6). At depth 31, 9.g4 was actually the 3rd option.  Harsh, but I ask you again. Are you going to trust a titled player or somebody turning on their engine for apparently a very brief period????  


05:24 moving on.....taking the pawn is ""not something I would recommend"" ....again with this teacher vs student thing. Why is a 1900 constantly ""recommending"" something like he is an authority in openings he has almost no experience in?  


05:39 We now move on to the 2nd move he doesn't recommend 3.d4. This seems like it's actually correct and no beef with that....HOWEVER.....we are no moving close to our main event. BRACE yourselves....We are soon there...but first.  


05:55 ""here you can choose between Bc4 and Be2"" ....errmmmm ok, if you are over 1500, why would anyone CHOOSE to play the move Bc4 just to immediately lose a tempo to black playing ....d5????  


06:18 YES, HERE IT IS. Pay attention!!! ""Nc4 leads to a much better position for black!""   At this point I'll note that it is true that 6.Ng4 is the best move according to the engines....but....wow just wow.  


06:20 ""black is actually just almost WINNING after this"" ....yes, you READ this correctly.  On the 6th move as white, with white having two pieces developed vs ONE piece for black.....Mr. Hanging Pawns declares...and this is a DIRECT quote: ""....loses here so let me show you HOW"" ......I don't really know how to do this with words. He now plays the developing move BISHOP TO E SEVEN. Yes, black is ""winning"" because he can now play the developing move 6...Be7 (N.B. only the 2nd best SF 12 move at depth 33). But look at this groundbreaking claim and ""discovery"" after white goes 6.Nc4 instead of 6.Ng4 he LOSES because black AGGRESSIVELY develops his bishop to e7 blocked in by all his pieces and THREATENING NOTHING? After 6....Be7 Stockfish 12 at depth 35 gives white a +0.58 score btw, but your fantastic authority in the opening has given the claim that white is losing!  


06:36 is another comedic moment when our hero says ""Probably Bh5 is what most people would play""  
....hmmm no Stjepan...Bh5 is not what any player rated above 1911 would play because Bh5+ gives up the bishop pair for absolutely nothing whatsoever. A check. There is a saying....""A patzer sees check....""  


06:44 This moment sums up too perfectly the shallowness of this player/channel ""...if I turn on the engine, it says -1 for black...."" This unfortunately is what he and other non-qualified players (sorry for the Elitism) do way to often. Turn the engine on for a split second and make an assessment. If you just turn the lichess engine on for 3-5 seconds it will give you an assessment at low depths of like 17-19 which is simply not relevant.  In fact if you cared about your viewers and wanted to give a well researched assessment it would give a mere -0.13 at depth 29 on Stockfish 12.  N.B. I am not the creator nor even a content creator but I am just showing you the SHIT standard that are adhered to here. I spent almost no time and immediately refuted this BS assessment by leaving my engine on for a little longer. Now....does this content creator not care at all about his viewers and misinforms them or does he simply not know better? Would a titled player make these mistakes?  


06:50 he goes on..""..black is just WINNING this position"" ....I mean is this even worth it anymore? Now my Stockfish is on depth 32 while I am writing this and it shows me 0.00 as assessment. Is this the work you want presented to you? Are these the opening videos you are going to recommend to a chess player that wants to improve?  


07:37 We've started analyzing 3.Nxe5 which probably is the most testing move, don't get me wrong, I call out a lot of BS but the guy gets some things right!  


 07:43 he brushes off a tricky line with Nxf8 and white wins. White actually needs to know his stuff and can get in trouble after ...Rg4 by black. True, it is winning if white is a computer but if you are preparing as a human you need to know what to do here. Actually same for the hxg6 line, which is bad objectively but people such as Rausis have played this with black. Again, the creator doesn't have enough knowledge/culture to brush things off or make claims here....leading to more comedy...  


07:46 Spending actual time on 4...Ke7 like anyone would actually play this ever without downing 17 shots of Absinthe (orginally I spelt this Absynth but I googled it and therefore spent probably more time researching my post than HP spent on preparing his YT video). FYI this is mate in 5 for white which HP goes on to demonstrate for you. Very important piece of information! So ""...Nc6 is a losing blunder"" ...I'll give a half truth here. It's not the best move but it's something tricky that people might play as a ""one-off"" and has actually worked for black in plenty of practical games.  


11:21 I was gonna fast-forward at this stage to the recommended line (wasn't his supposed to take only 10 minutes, easy stuff??) but then some more comedy hit me.  Our hero looks at the move 6...Bd7 for black.....WHAT??? No....actually WHAT???? I kept adding lines to my Stockfish to see in what place the move bishop to dee seven would arrive at. I resigned after I had added the top 10 lines. Guess what, there is a reason for that. Bd7 properly develops nothing, threatens nothing, protects nothing....basically it has no purpose. So why is this move even mentioned? Is it because our hero creator simply doesn't have neither the experience nor the capacity to think on his own about what is a plausible move to play in a position? I am getting too harsh but the more I look into this the more disgusted I get.  


11:44 YAWN....I am trying to get to the end of this supposed TEN MINUTE VIDEO. ""Bf4 is the move"" ..ok but why?  It's the 3rd most played move in the database behind Ne3 and f3 and both of those moves 66.5% and 75.5% score better than Bf4 64.5%  Stockfish 12 depth 30 also doesn't have the move in it's top 3. So again WHY?  


12:20 Interesting suggestion with 9.h4!? let's not keep it all negative!  


13:04 We finally reach the climax of the line recommended as ""the refutation"" of the Latvian Gambit.  


13:09 ""and after f3 black's position is much worse, this is the key position to study, this is what you want to reach"" Ok....so this line that at depth 31 in SF 12 barely reaches a half a pawn advantage for white is better than the one at 04:35 which the comp had as +1.85? Now maybe this can be disputed but is this REALLY the line that is supposed to ""refute"" the Latvian?  


The video goes on a bit and I could add further criticism but the gist of it is that this ""refutation"" is not refutation at all. In fact after 11.gxf3 by white 11...Nh5 at depth 33 on SF12 gives white an edge of +0.30 which is nice but hardly a refutation. Black will soon get his pieces out and in fact if white doesn't play like a machine his structure is in fact worse and he has no direct threats.  


Ok so yeah this was much longer than I intended but this video and the general praise in general was just getting to me because the content in general is very close to rubbish level if we just analyze it very briefly. The main thing that bugs me is the constant ""this is just winning for X"" when HP has barely had the computer on for more than a few seconds on bloody lichess. This is just misinformation and this needs to stop.

HP, I am sorry but this is a CALLOUT. Please put better or more work into your videos if you actually care about players/viewers.  If you don't know better, fair enough....but if you are making such half-assed mis-informed videos knowingly then shame on you!",1605066910

I took a small break somewhere a few weeks back, and since I have came back my approach to playing has been much different. Before, I would play one to two games a day and then write out all my moves as I played, add footnotes as I play, and then after the games go through and try to deeply analyze some mistakes I made or some minor inaccuracies I could improve on. Since I started playing again recently, I have been playing many games a day (\~5 a day, sometimes more if time allows) and not really deeply analyzing any of these games. After the games I kind of just go through the game once for 5 minutes, identify blunders/mistakes, and move on. I was wondering what you guys think is more beneficial to my growth as a chess player? I have heard some people say you just need to play a lot of games to develop pattern recognition and studying won't help as much if you aren't playing a ton. On the other side, I've heard people also say that deeply analyzing every single game you play is the best way to learn. I feel like my rating has been climbing faster when I play more games, but this could also just be due to me being slightly underrated and therefore playing many games slowly is leveling out at my actual rating.

My classical rating on lichess is like 1900 and my blitz is only like 1700, so no way should this be achievable unless my strategy is on the level of a 500 in order to compensate.

I also notice that once you pass 2k puzzle rating the puzzles stop getting harder, allowing you to solve them with 95% reliability with enough training. I think this is partially because there is not a large pool of 2600+ puzzles, since I keep getting puzzles rated around 2100. But also because the rare 2600+ puzzles are only marginally more difficult. In fact, if you showed me a 2100 puzzle and a 2600 puzzle, I guarantee I would not be able to distinguish between them at least 80% of the time. I mean, how can whatever software lichess and chess.com use to rate these puzzles be so bad when chess engines are so good?

I also notice I never see puzzles played between bots in lichess (bots are marked with a bot tag). Is this a conscious choice, and if so why? It seems like allowing bot games to become puzzles would be an easy way to generate very high rated puzzles.",1605038911

4672,Chess Football Variant,chess,"Move a “football” from one side of the board to the other. The football starts in the Kings possession, and moves with whatever piece is holding it at the time.

“Passing” the football takes the place of a turn - football is passed by moving a piece on top of another piece. Neither piece moves on a passing turn, only a transfer of which piece has the football. If a piece is taken by the opposite squad, the taking piece has the football. 
(I.e. pawns pass 1 space in front or diagonally)

If you want to do American football, then after the first pass, pieces can only lateral (transfer possession sideways or backwards) 

Checkmate also wins. Queen and rooks cannot handle the football because sports aren’t really their thing.",1605034784

4676,London System dark bishop question [900-1000 elo],chess,"https://imgur.com/xNKCqAU

I play exclusively the London System right now as white and I find myself in positions similar to the above quite often in my elo, specifically my dark bishop on f4 and the opponent attacking it with their dark bishop on d6.

A lot of times I find myself just trading bishops here even though as far as I understand white should not look to do this while playing London System. I just don't know what to do in this situation. Sometimes I will go to g5 but this is easily pushed away with h6 and then I am back where I started or I get trapped on h4, etc.

   [https://store.steampowered.com/app/377340/ChessBase\_13\_Academy/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/377340/ChessBase_13_Academy/)     
$19.99 is probably the cheapest way we can get a hold of a Chessbase program. Yes it comes with the database, although it isn't that updated. It's good for organizing and searching games though. I especially liked the feature where you can search games based on a subset of the pieces.    
  

2. [iChess.net](https://iChess.net) $1 membership Deal      
[https://www.ichess.net/shop/ichess-club/](https://www.ichess.net/shop/ichess-club/)

   This is quite a deal. For just $1 you can get $20 store credits which you can use to buy selected videos, which has an additional 40% off because of the membership. I suggest searching for an appropriate video first before using those credits. Being a member you can watch up 30 minutes preview of the video as opposed to around 5 minute if you're not a member. Also regularly check the email you've used to sign-up. They sometimes send promo links for course freebies. I got to download one, but the first promo link already expired because I didn't check the email early enough. Also you can cancel before your subscription ends if you're worried that you'll be charged when one month passes.

I saw that there is a free printable pattern on Wikipedia, do you think it could work to have it professionally printed on stock board and maybe laminated?

What kind of board material and details are important to chess players? If I got it printed, how big or small would you recommend so he can play it by transport it! Or, is printing it not a good idea, and I should just pay for the cardboard game version being sold?

They played the same moves if black or white. They played some non theory weird /weak line. They played the same moves for thousands of games so knew the line very well and could move very fast.

They at no point seemed to care about improving. They would have played the same moves 30 games in a row if they kept ending up in a losing position as long as they won on time.

The funny thing was in checkers at least its a very effective strat for fast bullet games. As you know the moves inside out. Your opponent wont have studied it because its so new to you they can play much faster and get big time leads and win lots up to a certain level of opponent.

Ive noticed the same thing in chess. Now definitely not as rampant as in checkers. But the same country again playing a similar way.

Weird/ weak moves. Playing them fast. Playing same moves if white or black and not changing from them if you get advantages will play you until they realise they cant beat you on time and will then stop playing you.

I guess each to their own, but i did look down my nose a bit at them in checkers. I didnt see the point in playing not to improve but just to win on time. So now ive noticed it in chess, im starting to think its maybe a culture thing.

Is this something thats known about in chess? Like it was known in checkers? Like certain players from x country will play this one specific line or way?

I thought it was maybe because 1500 being a new-account rating could be reflected in overrated accounts (which does seem to be somewhat), but it also seems like from a non-scientific check it looks like my opponents usually have higher Rapid than Blitz ratings (eg 1300 vs 1800 even).

4744,Just a thought about the nature of cheating in chess,chess,"Chess is a game with prizes and pride on the line. As such, some people will try to steal gold and glory through cheating.

The nature of cheating now is almost completely associated with using an electronic device running a chess engine. The engines have changed - Rybka, Stockfish, Komodo, and so on. The point is: most human players will certainly lose if pitted against a computer at crucial points in a game, and all human players will certainly lose if pitted against an engine under classical time controls. 

But as recently as 1997, in the famous/infamous Kasparov and Deep Blue match[Kasparov v Deep Blue Rematch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov), it was *human interference* alleged by Kasparov on behalf of the computer.

Within the lifetime of many of you reading this, the world champion of chess managed wins against *the* engine of his day. When he lost, he felt totally justified accusing the team at IBM of smuggling in grandmaster feedback in real time, and no one can say beyond a doubt he is incorrect. Now, no serious human player would even suggest they would stand a chance against Stockfish or AlphaZero under identical conditions.

In 23 years, humans helping computers went from plausible cheating scheme to completely laughable, no matter which human is playing the machine.

**Cons:** When he asks you to write down in the comments what time you want him to stream on twitch, he always asks you to convert it into Croation time (which if he just DM’ed me on discord 10 minutes in advance, I would gladly comb through the comments for him and convert everyone’s request into the proper Croation time zone equivalent!) Yes, I am not only a small-time donor to HP, but I’m also a dutiful HP-fanboy! 👍

In almost every game I play, someone's knight gets pinned to their queen or king. 

I don't play it much anymore but in the italian, I learned that when white plays c3 it prevents a knight from ever coming to d4, so if the f3 knight gets pinned at least another attacker won't come to pile up pressure. 

In Logical Chess by Chernev, maybe it was Alekhine that said that the ""antidote is worse than the affliction"", when referring to playing h3 after a bishop has pinned the f3 knight. 

So my question is, when is it ok to allow pins? When should it be prevented?",1604968539

It is one of the worst versions of computer chess I've ever seen, especially for one which costs money ($5 normally, I got it for $2). Here is what is wrong with it.

* The rules for stalemate are not programmed correctly. [Check out this screenshot.](https://imgur.com/lIIfMgi) If you can't tell what's happening, I had [this position](https://lichess.org/analysis/k7/8/5Q2/p1Bp4/6K1/6P1/5P2/8_w_-_-_0_1) and played Qb6 intending mate on the next move, but the game was called a draw by stalemate. This was against AI, but I don't even want to try and see if this is also the case in online play.
* Pawns can only promote to queens.
* The AI is super easy, really slow (10+ seconds per move as early as move 2), and the worst part is that their decision algorithm is completely deterministic. If you play the same moves every game, so will they. That includes their first move as white: they exclusively play Nf3.

Of course I don't really care about losing $2 on this, but the fact that developers try to profit off of work that is this lazy is kind of sad to see. Maybe that's why it's called Minimal Chess.",1604967681

couldn't place the knight on g4 so I developed queenside knight instead.} 4. c3

Nf6 5. Qe2 d5 {Played without considering the pin on the e pawn after exd5,

worked out okay but threw me off a bit. (After checking with the engine, I also

missed a nice tactic with Nxe4.)} 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Bxd5 Qxd5 8. Nf3 f6

{Restricting the knight on f3} 9. O-O e5 {Creating a strong pawn chain and

potentially setting up an outpost on d4 later} 10. c4 Qf7 {I didn't want to

retreat to d8, felt like I would waste a tempo later moving off the back rank,

also didn't want to block in either bishop, so Qf7 seemed reasonable.} 11. d3

push.} 20. b4 O-O 21. b5 Rc7 22. a4 Qg6 23. Kh2 Rd7 {Defeats the purpose of

could get f4 in.} 24... f5 25. Ng3 f4 {Saw that this hung my e pawn, but figured

I would have decent compensation for the knight and would be able to protect my

pawns after. It's very likely I couldn't and white sacrificing the knight be

worth solid counterplay. Need to check with the engine.} 26. Ne4 {Did not

however see the knight now has a strong outpost and the option of going to f2

which became a strong defensive position for him.} 26... Bf5 27. Nf2 Re8

figured it was time to bust the position open and see what happened. I think h4

would have led to a draw due to neither of us wanting to weaken our positions.}

38. fxg4 hxg4 39. hxg4 Qxg4 40. Ke1 {Realize now that (40. Rxf4) would have

created massive problems in my position, relieved to see white play a more

but it's important to note that I wasn't even considering the best move of Rxe5.

was only looking at king moves. May not have mattered, but my opponent

definitely could have had chances if he had allowed me to play on. Overall I

think I played fairly well, but I need to maintain a broader picture of the

4804,Help setting up Opening Repertoire on Chesstempo,chess,"TLDR: What is a bad chess player supposed to with an opening trainer, exactly?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there!

I've been stress-playing blitz on [chess.com](https://chess.com) for years, but moreso since March or so. Rating is 1350 on blitz, which is almost exactly my CFC ranking OTB as well.

I want to work through some books that I've amassed over the years on opening repertoire, by inputting the games into a trainer so that I can memorize them. Sitting and playing through a bunch of example games move by move on a board has not produced any meaningful results.

At the suggestion of my last teacher I bought a book on the Pirc which I've been trying to incorporate as black. So I tried inputting moves into ChessTempo's opening trainer (I'm willing to switch to a different trainer, it's just that this was the one that I found first). I have a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) How many different repertoire files should I have to learn an opening? Should I have one ""Pirc"" Repertoire, or branch it into sub-sections (e.g., Pirc - Austrian attack; Pirc - Classical)?

2) Should I be including commentary lines about why certain moves do not work (e.g., 6...c5 no longer works because it is met by 7. dxc5 Qa5 and 8. cxd6). Obviously I don't want to memorize error lines, but I do want to understand why they don't work.

3) Is the goal to include one or two model games, or just a heap of different games to test out to respond to errors? I bought the book '500 Pirc Miniatures' but I imagine throwing every one of those into a repertoire file is going to make a mess of things. But I've never made an opening repertoire before so maybe I'm wrong.

After completing developement, I usually find myself without an idea on what to do. I mostly just end up trying to push some pawns or setting up traps for my opponents, but as their rating increases, I see myself failing more and more and ending up being down an exchange or even a piece in the lategame. 

While I can usually still draw these games, I would like to get into an endgame with equal or better material, as I feel I have decent chances to win this way.

I originally thought Queen D8 but I could still see lots of moves Black could make, not to mention the fact that I don't see how I can stop those passed pawns.

For example:

Qd8

Kc2

BxBf3

gxf3

&amp;#x200B;

And from there, the number of possibilities branch out in too many options for me to see any obvious forcing win. Sure, you have a Queen and you can keep checking the King back and forth, etc, but I don't see any ""winning move"" that would lead to checkmate or that would guarantee black can't Queen any of the pawns. Those pawns seem still to be very strong.

I'm posting here because to make things worse, this is one of the few problems that came without any comments. Usually someone in the comments develops on why this is the best move, and rules out other possible moves. But here there was nothing.",1604938081

On my bad days, I am not able to solve simple puzzles. I get around 10-15% and I have to think a lot even for simpler puzzles which I would have solved in less than 10 seconds on my good days. 

Similarly, this affects the game performance too. On my good days, I am able to win games even after blundering pieces. On my bad days,  I am unable to convert extremely winning positions.  

The difference between good days and bad days is like my CPU power reduced to a single core from a quad core system.

The positional play of English+tactics daily over a year opened my eyes up to the London system but I carried over some of what I've learned to change it up. These are some hyper offensive variations but I've yet to see an unfavorable turnout for white. I've only been playing this way for a week, so I'm wondering what you guys think?

In the first one you sacrifice the c4 pawn (note: *almost* everyone takes because it looks like a free tempo+pawn) in order to push d pawn up to d4 attacking nc3. The first one is what I'd call the base version. The line is super sharp &amp; complex and ends in white's favor. Do give stockfish a minute to process the position, sometimes it takes a move or two to understand what's going on. Again, totally new line. 

[https://lichess.org/hGOD7kUo#39](https://lichess.org/hGOD7kUo#39)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's another one I stumbled across. Instead of 2. Bf4 in the london you go to to 2. Bg5, blacks f pawn to f7. If I got this in a club game I'd be thrown the hell off and I imagine my London system-loving family member groaning how much I over attack. Surprise surprise this works out for white. It   culminates in a queen trade and white ends up with an open center board and two bishops. Play becomes highly tactical.

So my Uncle is super into chess, and I would like to get him something related to chess for Christmas this year. The obvious choice(from someone who doesn't know anything about chess) is a chess set but he already has 3 and mainly plays online these days. I was hoping some of you would have some idea of a gift that he would like. He has almost every book to do with chess, and from what I hear he's pretty good at it (lmao this is probably so cringe to anyone reading this that knows about chess I am so sorry, I'm doing my best) He goes to a chess club once a week and has started traveling to tournaments(we live in NZ so Covid restrictions aren't in place) 

I was thinking maybe a t-shirt or something he could wear to these events with a chess pun or something along those lines. I'm really struggling to think of something that he would like and won't just sit in a drawer for the rest of time, so any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated!

4878,Is every chess match already written?,chess,"First, yes, I'm interested now in chess thanks to Queen's Gambit. Played during my childhood until a GM visited us in school and destroyed us in a simultaneous match, but that's another story. I watched the series, and picked a ""for dummies"" book on how to play more *seriously* only to be beaten here and there in lichess, that's ok, I'm not a prodigy, I don't eat enough tranquilizer pills lol.

My question is that, is every match already written? I've noticed there's openings, so there's a series of moves written in stone, and if you do this is called that way, but if you decide to move another thing is called in another way. I'm intrigued about Harmon vs Borgov 1, where he played the sicilian defense, and our protagonist had to ""accept"" the proposal of a open variant or go for a closed one. So, that match was already ""known"" until a certain point?.

But I have been switching from [C](https://CHess.com)hess.com to [Lichess.com](https://Lichess.com) . I am a low rated play of about 1600 on lichess and 1350 on [Chess.com](https://Chess.com).  


I just never ever lose games on [lichess.com](https://lichess.com) like I do on [chess.com](https://chess.com). Up two pieces and miraculously they make every perfect move(often perplexing to me) and just dominate. Or even games that I don't get up two pieces, but I play a really good game and they simply play 100% perfect moves. I am not saying that can't happen.. but it happens too much.   


And its not that it happens ""sometimes"" it happens very often. Games on Lichess really feel like I am playing a person my level, [chess.com](https://chess.com) is not the same. I don't know  how to explain it, but I can just tell.

*As comprehensive of a dataset as possible (ie lots of games)
*Low price and/or free

I'm very much interested in taking seriously some study of chess. Having read through the FAQ, I find myself a little overwhelmed by where to start, what to use and how best to utilise my time. Might I please have a little guidance?

My experience is only in having played friends and played briefly on some tactics trainers. I know what the pieces do, vaguely know a couple of openings some very basic opening principles.

Ideally, I might study a book that walks me through in a thoughtful way why I am making certain moves and decisions and how to think about what I'd like to achieve. 

Apologies if this is a very much repeated question. Having searched \`beginner guide site:reddit.com' and the faq, I find a lot of approaches and have litle idea about what might best help improve my understanding of the game.

4949,Is my chess puzzle solution bad?,chess,"Hi,

Let me first say hi and introduce myself :)

Hi!

I'm a 35y old boomer, who thought chess from someone whom I considered to be a second grandfather. After his passing 20 years ago, I didn't really had anyone to play with, so my early ""passion"" kind of went away. Now after watching Queen's Gambit, with M. Shaibell, a new spark came to life :)

So it didn't take more than one result to find the obvious [chess.com](https://chess.com). I took a few lessons, got intrigued with the puzzle and immediately got my premium pass... and here we are. I'm still learning and make a few mistakes on the puzzles, got about a 60% success rate. 

Now, here you'll find one of the latest puzzles I came across, and was wondering what you experts or even novices alike think about my solution (which was considered not the best by the app).

https://preview.redd.it/ckt28jbyq0y51.jpg?width=1048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af811ed98f93bd8f92941da57e61b3159332c60e

So the idea was first to go with b5 and kind of force him to defend his Queen. But according to the puzzle solution, it should be e5 first. I understand why, but I was thinking that using the rook as bait, he wouldn't be able to castle his King. 

As I said, I'm just a rookie, but am really wondering what your opinions are :)

Ok so Im new to the chess scene, I came from the initial pogchamps [chess.com](https://chess.com) held on twitch. From then i became a fan of hikaru, watched his yt videos n stuff. he seems very cool and mature, i did watch a video in which he admits something along the lines of ""Yeah i used to be a dick in my younger years"", which is somewhat understandable, but the more i look into the chess scene the more i see posts about what a dick he is and that most of the actual chess scene doesnt like him. theres alot of dick moves his made and even up till recently. Ive seen some old stuff of him telling an opponent off for winning a game against him, alot of miserable attempts to flag, letting his timer run out when his in a losing position instead of resigning etc. 

  
Is this still the case? if not when did it change ?

Ive seen him and gotham chess shit on the st louis club, is this common, does the  chess community not think highly of the st luois club, because theyve got great videos on yt for beginners like me lol i dont see anything wrong with them. 

Also whats the situation with Finegold is he also hated by the chess community ? i dont think his stance on the pogchamps situation was right, but at the same time he teaches chess for living lol. Do hikaru and finegold have beef?

4959,Newbie wrestling with time control vs. IRL,chess,"I'm a new player. I signed up for both chess.com and lichess, and quickly realized a fundamental issue (for me, anyway): due to an unfortunate IRL situation, regardless of time of day, I have to take unpredictable and usually rather lengthy breaks, making even generously time controlled games a problem (or at the very least, pretty disrespectful to my opponent). Correspondence games are great, and I do play them, but sometimes I still want to stay focused and immersed in a whole game all at once.

So, in addition to the correspondence games, I'm stuck between two options, maybe three:

1. Add in time controlled games, and either time out or resign when IRL gets in the way.
2. Add in unlimited time controlled games, and take long, random breaks sometimes (or resign).
3. Add in stockfish games, knowing I'm not learning nearly as much, but it's still kinda fun and better than nothing.

Another thing I thought of is playing against friends who would be understanding of my situation. Unfortunately I don't have any friends that want to play.

I don't want to be disrespectful, so I'd be inclined to simply resign if there's a chance I'll be gone longer than a couple of minutes. What would you all recommend? So long as I get good matches, I don't care about my rating, but I do care about not annoying the crap out of people.",1604830068

What i struggle with and it annoys me about chess is  that often ill get into a good position up material etc and on analysis i see myself up according to computer.

But i dont have the knowledge to convert an advantage to a win.

This makes chess annoying as in any other game if you play somone around your level and get a big lead you can finish them off.

Chess at least i cant. Its also frustrating because i cant comprehend a clear plan on how to progress to win from a good position.

Have any of you played starcraft? Its similar to the frustration i had with that game. Because its so mechanicly hard my hands cant keep up with what i wanted to do so that was frustrating.

In chess i can spot tactics in puzzle rush but against 600s in a live game i cant find a fork for the life of me. Even if i did and was up 5 pieces unless its a king vs a queen i wont be able to convert in an efficient maner.

4994,Anybody wanna help me with game I invented?,chess,"Hello all, never been on reddit before and idk if I'm even in the right place to ask this question, but the reason it interests me is because I play chess, so I figure it might interest other chess players. Anyway I've invented this game that I've been playing a lot, but only with family members and friends. I don't have a title but it resembles 5-man football being played on a chess board, so I've been calling it football chess. I don't have any illusions about this becoming a widespread popular game or anything, but even so, I have this desire to make it a real legitimate game that would withstand play at a very high level. The problem is my family members and I suck at chess so its only been played at a relatively low level (it is entirely strategy based, so the crossover would be very high after playing a few games, much like Arimaa or Go, but a lot easier). At the level we play at, it seems like the offense has a slight inherent  advantage, like 55/45 offense over defense. There are many rules I could put in or take out to equalize it, but I actually have no idea if that estimation is even correct because to really know I think I would have to have a really high chess IQ and analyzing skills, or have alphazero play itself a million times over and see what happens. Since no two members of my family have similar chess skills, I really have no way of knowing if the game is equal enough to be playable. So what I'm asking is, considering that everyone on here is bound to be better than me at chess, and have better insights, would any of y'all like to play around with my game, (and I'm almost sure you'll enjoy it if you do), play against friends you normally play with, and give me some feedback on whether it is doomed to be a game where very good equal players will win with offense and then lose with defense in an endless loop, or whether its fantastic and leads to great matches, which has happened in my experience. 

The game is very simple for chess players who are familiar with the game of football. Each team has 5 players represented by pawns, except the ball carrier on the offense is represented by a king. gameplay is started with a kickoff, the defense lines up in the first rank and then metaphorically ""kicks the ball"" to the back rank, where the offensive player has selected a pawn to ""receive the ball"" and turn into a king, the ball carrier. The rest of his pawns can be anywhere, but typically, strategy wise, in some kind of line, L or U shape around the king. These offensive pawns are blockers. For the offense to score a point, the king must reach the opposite side of the board from which he started. On each player's turn, they may move all their pieces one time, each piece may all move in the same way a king can move in chess. The defense will ""kickoff"" and then the defense may take its complete turn, moving each piece. The two sides will take turns advancing and meet somewhere in the middle of the board. As the defense and offense come into contact, pushing, or blocking comes into play. Simply put, any pawn may push an oppossing pawn backwards (not necessarily backwards, but in the opposite direction that the pushing pawn came from) and move into its place, as long as there is a vacant spot to push the other pawn into. This is how blocking works, the pawns try to clear a path for the king (the ball carrier) to reach the touchdown (the opposite rank). Of course the defensive pawns may also push back as they try to reach the king to tackle him. Tackling is done the same way as capturing in chess, you just land on the king. There is just one special rule with tackling, you can't tackle the king by going diagonally through two offensive players. So a defender on A1 can't tackle a king on B2 when there are offensive players on A2 and B1. If the king is tackled, play restarts with an offensive line on the rank that he was tackled on. The offense goes first on the next turn, and the king must start on any rank behind the ""rank of scrimmage"", and any file as long as there is also a pawn in front of him on that file. That is a just a complicated way of explaining how the quarterback is behind a center. As I play it, this is the last attempt to make a touchdown, though maybe it is necessary to add more downs as I don't know what gameplay looks like at higher levels. If the offense fails to make a touchdown on that down, it goes back to a kickoff like the start of the game, not just a change of possession like real football. Now it is the next team's turn to be on offense. After each team has had three turns at offense, you count the touchdowns each team has scored, if someone is winning, then they win, if it’s tied, then you continue switching offense and defense until a round where one player scored and the other didn't, effectively breaking the tie. 

So please play my game and give me your feedback. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad because I honestly don't feel like I invented this game, I feel like I discovered it, and I wanna know what other people think. Explaining the rules in writing seems really unecessarily complicated, in real life with a chess board it takes like 3 sentences to teach new people. If it seems complicated, just think of how you would play football with chess pieces. Also if there's a better place to ask this question that would also really help, please advise.

Turn is a 7 and then he fires $60, this is the spot I think I can fold but I just decide to call and fold to a river bet (maybe he's overplaying KT or doing something stupid with middle pair? Unknowns at 1/3 do all sorts of weird stuff. I'm really not loving this though).

River is a Q and he bets about pot and I snap it off (now I beat KJ which is plausible), and he actually had AT that rivered the nuts. I'm not really going to be results oriented here (obviously I know I can't fold if he had AT), and I know I can't fold river. The question is the turn.

*fold*, MP calls 1 BB, CO raises to 4 BB, *fold*, **Hero raises to 15 BB**, *fold*, *fold*, CO calls 11 BB

This is a clear 3-bet. I think 16 BB is slightly better but I like being cheeky with my sizings sometimes.   


Flop (32 BB, 2 players):  
 Qs7s7c  
**Hero bets 10 BB**, CO raises to 20 BB, **Hero calls 10 BB**

This flop I bet often. I have all the overpairs, top pair,  and the only possible full house here. Villain has quads (I guess) and tons of random middling pairs. You can argue for a slightly larger sizing but when range betting I like to go smaller. I like to get lots of cheap folds with hands like AK or AQ that miss the flop fairly often. The problem comes when I get minraised. The raise isn't quite large enough to fold too but it also makes me fairly cautious because you can't exactly be raising much on a board like this. Maybe a flush draw bluffs here but I block most of them with Ks and unblock trips. I'm very rarely going to be good after calling this raise, and even if I hit a K or A I might be in bad shape....I decide to call here and reevaluate on the turn.   


Turn (72 BB, 2 players):  
 4c  
**Hero checks**, CO bets 34.2 BB, ***fold***

Most turns are a blank like this so most turns I'm gonna have to fold. I don't like calling the flop just to fold most turns, but is the sizing too small to fold to? Also I debated turning AK into a bluff on the flop but wasn't quite sure if that was the right move. Sure villain's range is mostly middling pairs but idk if I can get those to fold on the flop especially with a flush draw possible. Thoughts on my play?

This is an easy 3-bet but CO 4-bets a bit large. Against a sizing like this I can definitely fold a lot more often but I prefer calling TT for the implied odds.   


Flop (60.4 BB, 2 players):  
Js4s3s  
**Hero checks**, CO bets 34.8 BB, **Hero raises to 69.6 BB**, CO raises to 74.6 BB and is all-in, **Hero calls 5 BB**

Besides flopping a set this is one of the better flops for me. I debate betting or checking but decide to check and hopefully hit my flush. In retrospect this was kinda stupid. Villain probably isn't 4-betting AJs  or JJ with this sizing very often but they're gonna have a lot of overpairs and some flopped flushes. They probably aren't folding overpairs on the flop but I can discourage shoves by donking here. I feel like 1/3 donk here would buy me a cheap turn and protect me from overpair shoves that deny me tons of equity.   


Anyway I check and villain goes half pot. My options here are basically shove or fold. I could call here but the SPR allows villain to bluff pretty much any turn with a flush draw. I leaned towards shoving because....I am not quite sure. Villain could easily have a stronger flush here (possible but unlikely)  or a pair+draw here than absolutely dominates my TT. I'm not quite sure what a shove here accomplishes  besides punting money against a range that is 9/10 stronger than mine. On the other hand TT is pretty much the top of my range here and if I'm folding TT I'm folding everything but JJ. All in all I'm not quite sure what the correct move was here....thoughts?

Bluff: scratching his nose/head

big tell : if he stares at you pre showdown and you have to call or fold

5126,Blocker hero calling question,poker,"2/5 home game. I open AQss in the CO to 15, BB defends. Assume BB is a strong, winning player and plays smartly but aggressively.

Flop (32) is 9s7c2s. Hero cbets 20, V calls.

Turn (72) 4c. Hero decides to check behind. We could barrel but we decide to check this combo to keep some FDs in range (in any case, that's not the main question).

River (72) 3d. Villain bets 80. 

How strong is our hand as a bluff catcher? 

We block spades, which sucks because spades missed and theoretically he could be bluffing with missed FDs. However, wouldn't villain be aware that spades would be a bad bluff (because he blocks us from having spades, which would more likely fold) and so he'd choose to bluff non spade combos like JTcc/T8cc? Which would make spades actually a better bluffcatcher, because we unblock his likelier bluff candidates like missed straight draws?

Basically, my question is, when evaluating blocking properties of hands how many levels deep should we be thinking? I feel like the conventional wisdom is choose bluffcatchers than unblock bluffs, but how do we construct a strategy when bluffcatching properties counteract each other?",1610414907

Learned that I need to stick to 20nl stakes for now until I am consistently winning. 

I only had the chance to play live my first 6 games or so, until Covid hit and then I've moved to online with friends which have stopped so now strictly play on PokerBros, but am eager to get back to live play. 

Only about a \~28k hand sample size - am am pretty much back to where I started, but do feel I've learned enough, and gained experience to create a foundation for a winning year in 2021. I am positive earnings lifetime overall, thanks to my 4th game getting 3rd in a local MTT. 

For 2021, I'm going to focus on studying and playing 6max and full ring SNG's - as Cash Games can get boring for me and I lose focus leading to sloppy play. My current goal now is to crush SNG's then make the switch to MTT's - but right now I don't have the time to dedicate to consistent MTT play. 

Excited to keep learning and growing and am loving the game as much as when I started.

5173,What spots are profitable early in MTTs?,poker,"Sorry beginner here and not quite sure how to formulate the question.

So let's assume were on the first hand of some largish field freezeout MTT 100bb deep. Let's say someone pushes all-in for 100bb and we're in the BB and magically know hes hand and our equity against it.

How would we figure out how much equity do we need for us to be able to profitably call ? I assume we wouldn't want to call with 51% as your not even beating the rake. What about 55%? 60%? 65%? and how would one begin to approach trying to figure out this number? Also if we double our stack first hand do we double the monetary value of our stack or does it not work this way?",1610379090

5175,guys guys guysss... I've finally found a solution to the dreaded 'bubbling' scenario in tournaments!,poker,"so picture this: you are in a tournament, there are 4 players left, and top 3 get paid. That means someone is about to go home with nothing :(

""But wait!"" All the shorter stacks pipe up, ""we can each pay the bubble!"" They all nod their heads in agreement and look at you in expectation... you with 70% of the chips in play. ""I think I'd rather just play this out"" you say. Their anger and wrath become visible to you. How DARE you not pay the bubble. How DARE you leverage your big stack and their fear of bubbling against them to secure and even more likely win.

""That's some bitch shit"" - one of them says. Another says, ""Yeah this is a friendly home game tournament.""

You suddenly remember why, even when your chip leader at the final table, you hate tournaments. You pull out 40 bucks of your wallet and pay the guy who had 3bb his due. Your enthusiasm for this game is gone. They all hate you for not chopping earlier 5 handed, as they hate you now for not chopping 3 handed. This game is now a chore for you, whereas earlier in the tournament it was fun.

So my proposal is simple. Instead of paying the bubble, we expand to 4th place getting paid. However that does create a new bubble, so we should expand to 5th place. Shoot, now there is another bubble! Ok how about this, every finisher get's  at least half their buy-in back and a participation medal. Fair?

I am looking for people who also have the goal to become an actual poker pro and live from poker.

I want to assemble a small and really close group/ a crew of max 4 to 5 people to study 6-max cash games and eventually MTT's to the extremes. I graduated university in the Netherlands and decided to live and pursue my long-time dream instead of getting a job in my profession. I am highly motivated and have all the time in the world to study and grind.  


About me: I am 22 years old, love to play chess, love the process of improving, work out 5 days a week, have a positive mindset, live healthy, creative, play guitar and really open to learn from people with new, diffrent and other perspectives and mindsets, like yours!  
The last 2 months I learned about mindset, GTO principles, the learning process and how to build a study plan to achieve my goals. Right now I will start playing 20% of the time and study/practice 80% of the time.  


The main focus of the group/ crew will be about:  


Discussing theory (Mainly GTO-based, especially in the beginning),  
Analysing relevant hands,  
Discuss mindset (and other ways to find edges in life that will help in poker),  
Practicing together,  
Pushing each other’s limits,  
Coach each other and create a learning environment.  


Etc. Etc.  


Are you excited, highly motivated, full of passion, do you speak Dutch (preferably) or English at a decent level and do you have time to study/preform poker 40 hours+ a week? Then contact me here, on 2+2 or on discord: 0bnxiusT0dlr#1932",1610374598

UTG+1 raises to 240, MP calls, CO calls, Hero calls, BB calls.  

Flop - Qc 6d 5d.  Checks around to CO who bets 1,000 in to a pot of 1300\~.  I suspect he's betting large to protect a made hand from the draw-heavy board facing 4 other players.  I have a lot of equity against almost all his holdings, I want to build the pot and possibly dissuade him from firing again if I miss the turn.  I raise to 2,350.  In hindsight I probably should have just called, allowing other players to stay in the hand possibly and reevaluate on the turn with less of my stack invested.  It folds around to CO and he shoves for 8,500\~.

I am personally not a fan of faster structured tournaments and avoid them most of the time, however I wanted to get your thoughts and opinions on whether or not they would be a viable source of income for my bankroll, or if their variance-heavyness would cause more headache then its possibly worth. I will include my stats obtained across ~800 MTTs so far to give you a better idea if I might stand a legitimate chance at turbo ROI. If they are, my plan would be to increase my bankroll to about 200-250 Buy-ins before giving them a shot, to account for the increased variance

-What are the biggest strategy adjustments needed in regards to the faster play structure? I would have to assume push-fold and calling all-ins would be a lot wider than normal

5189,nl5 postflop and pre flop.,poker,"First example, I open from UTG with KK and BB calls. Flop comes dry, something like A73 rainbow. That's a very good to c-bet with my range so I c-bet. V calls, I c bet the turn and he calls again, he checks and I check, he shows A2o. How to deal with this bullshit? Don't people know that kickers exist for a reason? I don't know what to do on these stakes after they call my c-bet honestly, I don't know if I should c-bet the turn or I should check. If I check every turn after my c-bet is not working, aggro people are gonna eat me alive.

Second example, I open from UTG with AhQhs and an aggro player calls from BB. Flop comes KsTs7h and this aggro player bets OOP for 75%. What do I do in situations like these? It happens a lot. Even when flop comes with all spades As 5s 8s, a lot of times an aggro fish is gonna bet pot or 75%. I don't know if they hit hands everytime but I literally don't know what to do against it.

Third example, that's more of a rant because I can't do anything against this. How do these people call huge 3 bets with trash against my monsters and hit hands? I have an example. I have aces UTG, I open  and a guy 3 bets my on the btn with KJs, I 4 bet a lot and he calls. Flop comes 7sTs4h (something like this). I bet 75% on flop, he goes all in, I call and he gets flush on the turn.

One more example I'm in SB with AKo, CO opens, I 3 bet him and bb calls this 3 bet. Flop comes A38 rainbow, I bet. Turn comes another ace, I bet again and BB goes all in, I call and guess what. This guy has A3o HAHA. Just fucking how. It's not like I 3 bet small, I'm on a larger side and they still call.

Last thing which is bleeding money on flops I didn't hit. I open from UTG with AK or AQ, flop comes dry with a high card which I didn't hit. When I have AK, flop comes with a Q on the flop, I c-bet and someone calls. So now I check the turn, a guy bets 75% and I have to fold, I lost 50 cents. I lose a lot of hands like these and from 50 cents it goes to a buy in just because people hit hands and I can't do anything against it.",1610358258

Pretty crazy preflop action. UTG opens to 5x and everyone decides they wanna hop in. I decide to 3-bet to 5x (basically a 4-bet) and everyone decides they STILL want to hop in. At this point I resign myself to the set or jet fate and hope for a lucky flop. Did I play this right? Should I just shove preflop instead?

5226,Question about preflop push/fold charts,poker,"Hey everyone,

I want to get into spin and gos. Before doing so, I'm using the Preflop Plus app for iOS to look at Nash solutions for &lt;/15bb game states. However I'm not certain on whether the numbers it gives account for the BB that is in the pot. 

For example,  [https://imgur.com/a/OVfpuKC](https://imgur.com/a/OVfpuKC) shows the solution from the BB against a button jam at 15bb, and 22 is losing 0.53bb as a call (if the button is playing push/fold at 15bb which he likely isn’t but w/e, this is just an example). What I'm asking is, does this -0.53bb mean that calling 22 loses 0.53bb (the EV of your stack after the hand will be 14.47bb, thus better than folding which leaves you with 14bb), or does it mean that calling loses you 0.53bb more than folding (so the EV of your stack if you call is 13.47bb and you should fold).

BTN opens so I decide to get aggressive and 3-bet. CO calls unsurprisingly but BTN decides to shove which is a bit strange. My hand should still have decent equity against villain's shoving range so I'm not too worried about the small stack. I'm more worried about this call station in the CO that could ruin my day by 5-bet shoving my flat. I have a very difficult choice to make here. Do I think I have enough equity and fold equity to just shove it in preflop with AQo? Or will the call station be too sticky and I'm better off just folding? I debated calling too but decided I didn't want to risk getting shoved on and being forced to fold which is VERY likely to happen when preflop action is this crazy. In the end I decided to shove but I'm not sure that was the right choice.

If CO here is calling with 33 I have basically zero fold equity here and my shove is basically a punt. I don't expect to be behind very often against the BTN shoving range but if CO is always getting it in with their small pocket pairs all my equity is being stolen away by CO turning my shove into a net loss. I really dislike multiway situations specifically because you can get fucked over by other people playing really badly like calling too wide. 

  
I'm asking a very simple question here, do I call shove or fold ? I leaned towards shoving because I don't want to call and see the other big stack getting in and be forced to fold and my hand should have high equity vs the BTN shoving range. But is folding here better? Villain flatted instead of 4-bet so they're not gonna have hands like QQ, KK or AA very often but they're gonna have lots of middling pocket pairs that have a slight equity edge here that will be calling. Will the CO fold to my shove often enough to make it profitable or should I just fold AQ and leave the shoving for premium pairs?",1610239192

5278,How exactly does one start studying poker?,poker,"I'm a student working towards my master's in pure maths with a minor in music. Heading into school, I was looking for something on the side that I could do as a hobby, when my buddy introduced me to the wonderful game of NLHE poker.

Since the beginning of last year, I spent time understanding the rules of poker, and eventually learning basic strategy. I'll hop on a 5NL table and the occasional $2.20 tournament on PokerStars to gain an understanding of the online scene and micro-build my bankroll. Having not been of age before lockdown in my city, I haven't had the chance to play any live games aside from four-handed poker nights with friends that don't really know how to play.

Lately I've been really interested in taking a more technical approach to the game, and understanding more advanced poker concepts in order to apply to and get more comfortable with higher stakes games. I'm wondering what I can do, apart from YouTube videos, forums, and preflop charts, to truly improve my game. How do I go about actually *studying* poker?

The end goal is to just get better. It would be nice to know what I'm doing if and when I decide to enter the live scene.",1610230792

Logic being that even a something Like j9o is ahead of me right now. Am I a total fish for raising in the first place or is that standard? Should my raising range be tighter when the big blind is a short stack? Should I have just folded 54s pre expecting this? Should I have called since it was around 8 BB more?",1610229191

He just wants to play one of the Sit  and Go Tournaments, not the promoted ones. It seems odd that they wouldn't let someone play  a simple Sit &amp; Go  or a regular one until they play enough ""live dealer"" games. is there another way to get tournament dollars? the only thing it's letting him play is live dealer, but it's only against the dealer.

5294,Live tourney hand with 97o. (Am I doing the math right?),poker,"I’m primarily a cash game player. This was my 3rd ever live tourney and I had an interesting hand that I wanted some advice on. 

- Level 3 of a $140 tournament. Blinds are 100/300/200BB ante if I remember correctly. Starting stack is 20k and I’m in the BB with 9s7c. I’m sitting with about 19k (63BBs). We’re playing 7 handed. Folds to MP who raises to 700 (16.5k stack), button calls (35k) and I choose to defend for 400 more with 97o. Somewhat suspect call I guess, but both villains were very aggressive and bluff heavy so I think it’s an okay defend, right? 

- Pot (2400)

- Flop was KQ7 rainbow. I check, and it checks around.

- Turn: KQ77 completing the rainbow. On this miraculous turn I lead out for 1500. The MP preflop raiser calls and the button folds. Pot (5400). 

- River: KQ779. What a beautiful runout for our holding. I went back and forth on a sizing here but I decided on a valuey sizing of 2500. The MP villain basically snap jams for 11.8 more. Hmmm. I end up calling with bottom full house, and he flips over QQ for the winner. Just a cooler, right? The main reason that I called was because this player would probably do this for value with KQ, J10 and possibly even AK. I can also see his turning AQ/AJ/A10 into a bluff occasionally. 

- I’m still trying to to learn poker math, so bear with me and let me know if I’m doing this correctly please. I’m almost certainly not doing it correctly but I’d like to learn how to do it the right way. I’ve listed the value hands he could have above (the combos that beat our hand are 3 combos KK, 3 combos QQ, and he’s capable of making the turn call with 99 so let’s give him the last combo of 99. 7 value combos that beat us. Now value hands that we beat.. He would maybe take this line with AA 1/6 of the time so 1 combo of AA, and maybe he’d do this with AK 1/3 of the time for 4 combos. Let’s also say he’d do this 66% of the time with KQ, so 6 combos. Also there is 16 combos of J10 and he would probably always take this line with that hand. 27 combos of value hands that we beat. Now for his possible bluffs. 16 combos of AJ, A10 and 12 combos of AQ. 44 total combos. Maybe he’d do this 1/4 of the time with any of these hands so 11 combos. 

- So he has 7 combos that beat us, and 38 that we beat. That means we only have to be good 1/5.5 times right? (38/7). And we would have to call 11.8k to win 19.7k, so I’m getting 1.66/1 odds, right? (19.7/11.8). So mathematically it is a slam dunk, correct? Sorry for the ridiculous amounts of questions in this posts, but I am curious as to if I’m doing this correctly and if not, how to do it correctly. Thank you guys!! 

- Apologies in advance for the formatting.. I’m doing this on mobile. Thanks again! r/poker is the best and most helpful subreddit!",1610216536

5296,Life at BetOnline Microstakes,poker,"Wanted to [share](https://imgur.com/gallery/7oZAhm3) results with the sub who taught me plenty. $150 initial deposit in the summer of 2015. Brought it up to $300 at NL2 and increased that to $400 at the NL5 Boost tables. Then BetOnline (in their infinite wisdom) got rid of anything lower than NL10. Playing the regular 6-max and Boost NL10 games, I had a ten buy-in downswing but have been figuring things out since then. Been exclusively playing NL10 Boost (only a single table) the past year. The rake is obscene, but it is what it is. Long stretches of inactivity are due to a growing family/young children. 

I enjoy keeping track of my net worth every month or so, and the poker account balance is a line item on that spreadsheet. Since I don’t own database software I apologize for the horizontal axis in days instead of #Hands

Curious as to where my stats are falling, I’ll determine them by hand after occasional sessions by running through HHs. Lately I’ve been running 21/17 with a 6% 3b. 

There are basic rules I follow. Don’t get into pissing matches with other regs as that’s not where the money will flow from. Iso casual players, focus on position, don’t play big pots out of position without solid hands, only run bluffs when the board works out well, and don’t call big river bets without the goods. And take notes every chance you get. I’m a bankroll nit (like you couldn’t tell). If there was an adequate population at NL25 Boost I would move that way, but the game doesn’t even run 95% of the time.",1610214146

5315,Is This Even Allowed/Against The Rules? Pokerstars unfairly confisicates money,poker,"My friend has been a professional poker player for the past 4-5 years. before that he was working elsewhere and got into huge debt. Anyway he managed to clear most of it by playing poker - he made 1-2M USD via Tournaments over this span of time. 1-2 years ago I loaned him some money to play. He binked a tournament (think it was for 100k+) and paid most of his other creditors except me.

Anyway Pokerstars had some bullshit reason and withheld his money for several months. He had a really small withdrawal limit, I cannot remember the exact amount but maybe it was like 20k USD per month and he clears his other creditors first. 

I got fed up with it and wrote to Pokerstars Email support on his behalf (since he's mainland chinese and cannot really write in english), demanding for them to release the funds that were rightfully mine.  


They then claimed that gambling/playing on their site under debt is against their T&amp;C and confisicated the remainder of his funds (20+K). They refuse to reply to any of his emails now. I think this is extremely ridiculous, and the one getting F\*ked hardest is me, for being kind enough to lend money to my friend. My friend cleared all of his Bank Debt which was killing him in terms of exhorbitant interest rates, but he still owes a little to a couple of friends. I'm the biggest creditor at 30k USD which is why i am last to get any money (most people in this spot will rather clear multiple small creditors instead of one big creditor)

I interpret the small bet as a draw trying to set a price. But in retrospect villain is going to spike sets here some chunk of the time, and while I have TT villain's range is going to have a lot more sets than mine. Raising here was probably my biggest mistake in the hand.

This is a really good flop for me.  I debate whether to donk here or not because this board should be amazing for my range but I'm OOP and this board is extremely wet so it's probably better to just check in general. Was this a mistake? Also if I donk here what sizing should I use? 2/3 pot?

This is a really good turncard for me so I....check. In retrospect I think a pot lead would be good here but I thought villain would continue c-betting.

I 2x overbet the river to get value from Jh, Kh, maybe even Th. Idk at this point I can't really go for thin value because villain will fold any hand that isn't a flush (and they'll have very little flushes after checking the turn) so my best bet is to go big and charge the few hands villain has that will call.

5339,A coach for using gto+,poker,"I'm new to using gto+

2 questions. 

1.
I've a decent idea how to get a basic set up of it going, such as how to enter ranges and weight them, and how to input the net sizes etc.
Basically I can solve a solution.
But I'm somewhat unsure of how best to use this information.
Question is. 
Can someone recommend either a really good place to see someone using this online, be it YouTube or a training site, that's free. 
Or if someone can recommend a coach who could maybe do a crash course with me on this for an hour or two 1 in 1 for a small fee. 


2
I've also seen a video online where someone had a solution solved, and then they went into the tree, and removed a check option.
Question is.
Once you solve a tree, is that tree solved for all bet sizes. Imagine I only have a 70% bet option when I solved it. But once it's solved, am I able to go to that solution and change bet size to 30% only, and see correct answers for that without having to process the entire database again.
I'm guess this isn't possible, but thought I'd ask, because obviously being able to change 70 to whatever number of bets I want is a lot less time consuming than running the solver again because I want to change a single bet size.",1610159723

I'd describe my current level as a break-evenish player at 0.02/0.05NL on PokerStars, which isn't too satisfying. Before starting to play I completed some free fundamental courses and learned basic strategy and concepts. Then i got my preflop ranges somewhat strucutred and memorized. Since then I've just been playing and don't know where and what to study next.

Most recommended online courses cost a few hundred bucks, which is more or less my current bankroll and it feels like I'd be skipping a step enrolling them already. On the other hand I find a lot of free stuff which is described as obsolete. Same goes for most of poker books. I don't know whether it would be even beneficial to read them now.

I'd love to hear from some more experienced players what I should do next and what the general process and consecutive steps of learning poker are. Some concepts with which I feel I'm struggling are correct bet sizing, applying exploitative strategy and pressure and when to bluff (I watch twitch poker streams sometimes and they often say they're gonna bluff the river if certain cards come and I completely don't get it).

Obviously I can see why this could be a fold as they could have you bettered with AK, AQs and so on, but now I'm not so sure due to things such as having a less predictable hand (whereas theirs would be more straightforward), not being dominated with things such as A8s or A9s, hitting lower boards far better, etc.

In other words, should I be more inclined to play the likes of 89s than the likes of KQo in these positions because I'm less likely to be dominated and I'm more likely to hit on a middle/low board, or should I just fold this sort of hand in this sort of position all day every day?

I’ve always enjoyed playing online poker. I had some success in the micro Hold’em NL MTT’s years ago, but in the past few years, I didn’t have the chance to play too seriously. I still enjoy watching poker and vlogs on youtube. 

Lately, my wife has been enjoying watching poker and learning about the game with me (great news!).

The online concept makes it easier for her to follow the plays, and makes it easier for me to explain her the game in details. We’re also avid travellers, so having beautiful images of his travelling is also super interesting for us.

Unfortunately, Brad Owen hasn’t uploaded any other videos like these. I’m hoping the poker community in here could direct me to some online content similar to the one I just described. Perhaps that way, I could get my wife seriously into the game, nothing would make me happier!

In good position only i play JJ, AK offsuit, AQ suited, AJ suited, 1010 i play if i get to see the flop for a good price.

In a Double or Nothing tournament, how are you playing your range in this situation? Villain is a TAG Reg who just popped up at my stakes this week. We have very little postflop history with them but we've seen them defend their BB fairly wide vs steals and we've absolutely seen them leverage ICM.

At the time I was thinking something like the below

**No pair, no club** \- Check

**Non-nut flush draw** \- Check

**Any pair/set, no club** \- Check

**Pair/Overpair with flush draw** \- Bet 1/2 pot

**Nut Flush draw -** Bet 1/2 pot

**Flush -** Bet 1/2 pot

Thinking back on it I'm wondering if this is wrong. The flat payout structure doesn't reward me for getting into a war with the other big stack who can make me fold a lot of my range if they decide to shove. If I'm only betting flushes then villain can just fold all flops and barrel me off of the rest of my range when I check.

======================================


I understand that due to the rake at microstakes zoom, you shouldn't be limping in position very much (if at all). However, at 150bb+ deep I call in position in CO/BTN with [22-99, A6s-A9s]. From particularly the suited ace high hands, I have saved my red line a lot by floating with good equity/good removal from V's range. Also being in position is nice. Players don't seem to squeeze enough in these pool for me to get exploited by anything BUT the rake from VPIPing in these spots.


Otherwise, I know that it's a meme for a microstakes player to try and work with solvers, but just out of pure curiosity I've been attempting to interpret specific spots that I've found to be recurring. So far, if I filter for some of these spots specifically I've been doing great, but obviously the sample is far too small in these spots to tell yet. Mainly, it's just been a point of comfort in attempting to take some of the guesswork out of how to play some of the spots I've been facing a lot. (i.e. what to do OTF OOP as the 3bettor with TPTK no FD/BFD on a connected board that semi-favors IP range)


The solver work I've done by no means shapes the general way in which I play (mainly just trying to take players to value town, and overfolding in underbluffed spots to exploit player pool), but rather I'm just trying to understand the game better through certain spots.

So many limpers idk what to do. I decide isoing to 5x but in retrospect it was too small. Maybe something like 6x or 7x? When there's this many limpers strong but not nuttish hands like AQo feel really awkward. On one hand I don't want to limp because this hand plays terribly multiway, I obviously don't want to fold such a strong hand, but I don't want to commit too much of my stack preflop with so many players left behind me. All in all it's an extremely shitty situation where up is down and right is wrong. 

I get minraised and while I could just call I don't want to give MP the odds to squeeze so I 4bet. BTN shoves so while it sucks I think I gotta fold here. Sure villain is gonna bluff sometimes but it's more likely he has a hand like TT or JJ or QQ trying to get it in preflop before a scary overcard comes. Did I play it alright?

Flop (6 BB, 2 players):

This bet was wayyyy too big. Usually when facing large bets like this I like to call and fold on the turn unimproved. If villain is barreling big like this on a dry board my pot odds skyrocket if I hit.

SB bets 7.2 BB, **Hero calls 7.2 BB**

Calling the turn was probably my biggest mistake here. I wasn't getting the correct odds at all. I guess after the turn paired my plan was to turn my hand into a bluff if a spade came on the river. Not the best plan, not a very smart plan, but it was a plan I guess.   


River (29.2 BB, 2 players):

SB bets 20.8 BB, **Hero calls 20.8 BB'**

I luckbox the straight on the river and villain bets large. No real need to raise here and folding is pretty much out of the question at this point. I had a spade blocker so less chance that villain has a flush and I don't really see many flushes taking this line at all.

5408,Questions to always ask for each hand?,poker,"After watching a Doug Polk video last night, I realized that even though I have a tighter range, more profitable playstyle, and a general edge over enough of my opponents to win at the stakes and format I currently play, I lacked basically any skill to actually analyze ranges and pick actions that are best post-flop. So I've committed to asking questions that actually matter before I act, instead of just thinking ""that guy shoved with J3s, he could have anything! i'm betting again!"" I'm starting out small so I can just make this a reflex, something that I do automatically every hand, every time. These don't form complete analytical pictures yet, but I can't yet answer these questions right every time  when I only have 30 seconds to act so I'm starting here. Here are questions I've been asking so far:

Pre-flop, I cover up my hole cards and watch everybody's action. Polk pointed out that looking at your cards right away can cloud your judgement of what your opponents are doing and which ranges you should be taking which actions with. I also decide what range I'm calling, raising, and 3-betting with before looking if I have enough time. Then I act, and remember which range my opponents should have me on, and how strong my actual cards are compared to that range.

On the flop, I ask, ""who has the nut advantage?"" and ""who has the range advantage?"" These questions help me make better decisions because I know who should usually be protecting their stack and who should be more comfortable taking it to the felt.

I am winning a lot of money at showdown so I don't think I'm making a ton of bad decisions on later streets, and again, I'm starting small so this can be just automatic, but as these basic questions get easier to answer I will add more advanced stuff to fill in a better analytical picture. What questions are you always asking? How do you avoid straying too far away from solid poker when you are tempted to just fire into opponents who have shown weakness before?

Some opponents are extreme. For example they can be so loose and passive (80vpip, 0pfr. Yes, really!) that I feel that I have no choice but to make thin value bets and make tight folds when they raise, but I still ask these questions first and then make adjustments based on what kind of player they are. The more extreme and frequent their mistakes are, the bigger the adjustments I can make. But I won't call my opponent's check-shove with bottom pair just because they shoved K4o preflop once. I have to have better reasons than that.",1610052928

5412,WSOP App - Playmoney Poker strategy and bankroll,poker,"Yes, they exist, the people that play poker with playmoney only. It’s just for entertainment and nothing bad can happen, but this also leads to an environment where the players don’t respect your raises and are just calling everything. Unless you play the 2-3 highest stakes/tables.


So it’s your turn to adapt and exploit the fish.
For beginners it’s great to learn about the structure and „how it works“, but it has nothing to do with real cash games.
Every 2/4 cent real money table plays more serious poker than the 90% of the WSOP Playtika players.
I will explain where you find the 10%.
That beeing said it’s a fun experience to get into the game but if you ever plan on playing for real cash and are a beginner, avoid this.


I am at 18 Billion chips now and would like to share some tipps and tricks on how to build a bankroll and „where“ and „how“ to play the WSOP „cashgames“.


1.) Learn to fold. Seriously. I got a pre-flop fold percentage of ~48 % and yes, that is super tight for WSOP App games.
Whenever I check the profiles I usually find 10 % (lol) to 35% pre-flop fold statistics so the „Game“ for most players is less poker mathematics but watching flop action. Keep that in mind and expolit this.

2.) Hence my next advice, be patient. Act like are a glitch on the table that calls or raises accidentally. Wait for good hands . But don’t play like a robot that only plays KK and AA on the button.
Calling with TJ or 89 as suited connectors out of position is not a bad idea because sometimes even the other players register that you are only in action with strong hands.
Someone that folded 30 turns and only played his blinds and even folded SB here and there is suspicious when raising. Not every table has 9 clueless donks.

3.) Raise once in a while. Only calling Leads to the usual flop action where 7 of 10 players are still in the pot and you will be wrecked in the river so often.
Forcing the loose players to pot size bets makes some of them hesitate and fold their 59 preflop that might catch the 9 and 9 on the Turn and River.

4.) Players that hit the flop even with the lowest pair won’t fold, and thats were you get your playmoney profit long term.
Most of them refuse to surrender and even call pot size bets on the turn and river even if they are beat.

5.) The WSOP Playtika App always suggest you play the maximum possible buyin tables and ignores bankroll management. That is your responsibility.

I usually only play with 10-15% of my Bankroll, but I play with Auto Rebuy (that only will be an issue because playmoney has variance, too, and your well played all in flush might eventually lose on the river) and Auto Top Off. That means I always play with the maximum buyin/BB on that table to get paid when I hit the nuts and face another player that fuels a big pot.

It’s the worst feeling to win less because you could not maximize the pot bets.

6.) You remember the 10 % I mentioned that „somehow“ play more serious Poker?
They exist, but you only find them in the last third of the High Stakes tables.

The Playmoney WSOP tables are structured like this with Stakes and Buy In Ranges:

- 5K/10K - 50K/1.25M

- 10K/20K - 500K/2.5M

- 25K/50K - 1.25M/6.25M

- 50K/100k - 2.5M/12.5M

- 100K/200K - 5M/25M

- 300K/600K - 15M/75M

- 600K/1.2M - 30M/150M

- 1.25M/2.5M - 62.5M/312.5M

- 3M/6M - 150M/750M

- 6M/12M - 300M/1.5B

- 12.5M/25M - 600M/3B

- 30M/60M - 1.5B/7.5B

Once you play at the 6M+ stakes tables you will face a different type of players:
Many have levels of 200 and 300 and more which means they grinded fast and/or well. They play this game at least more than „casually“ and more focused and act slightly tighter.
The pre flop percentage usually is above 40% so there are less limpers and calling stations.
Be careful if you find 50% pre flop folders and &lt;5% post flop raisers. They will have strong hands once they start betting and raising.

The most „serious“ playmoney poker gamers are in the last 2 tables, because the 3B table is an equivalent of ~ 90 Euro/Dollars and you won’t find casuals here that throw away real money.
Players of the highest playmoney limits actually follow fundamental poker strategy and respect your behavior and raises.
You will find players there with way better reads and you won’t find casual limpers that play for the action.

So the good news is, you CAN have a somewhat serious full ring poker action at the WSOP playmoney community.
The bad news is you have to grind through the donk festivals of the first 8-9 limits and tables.
It’s frustrating sometimes but be patient, fold often and make the calling stations pay with your sets.

- ignore the Momentum
- ignore the Slot Machine
- a big friendlist is nice for many free chips here and there 
- ignore the obnoxious Piggy Bank

Still confused about BB leading out here but if he absolutely has to do it i think he just ships it here with the nuts, also somewhat worried about the third diamond, but im getting 2.5:1 on my stack before BB gets to close the action, so possibly 3:1, and again i think UTG+1 reraises a flushdraw on the flop, i have a straight and half the Ts in the deck so i figure its probably good.

Do i just fold here? ever?

ATd, KTd, QTd is not unlikely for either of them. I might be too sticky here with a straight generally which i guess is primarily what im worried about. Not so much in this pot because of how they played previously.

He made me go through a booklet, gave me pills, then told me to come back in a week. it quit a few days later and I never went back. a month or two later, I had a mild psychotic break. no voices, no sensory hallucinations. i just believed insane shit. ask negreanu, doyle, hellmuth, or ivey if they remember the mad man messaging them ten years ago. they all blocked me, so they must remember. anyways.. it quit in a month. my brain felt like mush.. i went to the hospital and got admitted. mind you, this doctor knew fuck all about me. he didn't ask me my history, or anything. he said ""you have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. i was like OKAY?!?! and he gave me pills and kicked me out. for the next 4 years, I couldnt do anything but assume my brother was dead if i couldnt see him. four years. the doctor finally changed my pills saying he didnt want to because i was stable. i thought.. okay... then i was fine. here is the thing.. i never made a friend the last ten years. hid inside, gambling with no money, living with my parents. this is from the pills. it exasperated my schizoid personality disorder. its just from youth bullying.. then u like being inside on a bad level. but it made me super schizoid. during this all, id get headaches and my 2nd doctor assumed it was schizophrenia for some reason. my prior doctor diagnosed me with it, and this was all that was happening. hed change my pills.. never a sensory hallucination or voice or mood problem. the headache was impossible to describe, but i always said it wasnt that bad and it didnt feel like schizophrenia. anyways.. he didnt even ask about cannabis or anything about me the first appointment. the original doctor. anyways.. two months ago, my 3rd doctor took me off antipsychotics and antidepressants and i was just fine. he literally destroyed my life. you'll see me at wsop 2021 with a crippled arm. i got a movement disorder from the pills. years taken off my life. but my lawyer is talkin settlement of around 175k if its like simillar cases hes handled. good. i seen my first doctor two years ago and he said i was replying to voices in our ONE meeting. lmao no i wasnt. he said nothing about voices and neither did i. he made me go through a booklet, then gave me pills, and kicked me out. like he didnt ask me anything. then i was schizoaffective. i wish my arm wasnt perma-crippled or id be happy to have 175k on a larger level. lmao 175k and all it cost me was 40 years on my life. woohoo",1609976635

5496,Solver 3bet Pot Bet Sizes,poker,"Hi

I'm very new to solvers and I'm using gto+. 

I'm trying to find a somewhat standard range of bet sizes to use for the solver for the most common situations and would love some feedback or any obvious problems.

The situation is 6max.
And for the work I'm doing, I'm only focusing on the 4 non blind positions and the Preflop action is always an opener, followed by a 3bet from an in position in which the initial raiser calls.
And the Flop always checks to the raiser. 

And my defaults here are. 
Flop. 
IP can check or bet 40 or 70% of pot, and OOP can either call, or check raise 50% pot. To this IP can call or go all in. 

Turn. 
If Flop was check call, we use the exact same IP check or bet 40% or 70%, with OOP being allowed to check raise 50% Pot again. 
If Flop was check raised, now OOP can bet 40% or 70%, and IP can call or raise 50% pot. 

River. 
Same as turn, except this time OOP can lead out shove and the IP can also go all in.


So I'm just wondering, is there any clear issue with the sizes in using. I feel like it covers both the bigger and smaller C-Bet Sizes, and it allows for a decent enough check raise size on each street. And it allows all the money to get in on the river.


Again, I'm completely new to solvers, but I want to be able to solve these 7ish non blind spots for 3bet 6max hands so I can practice. 

Is there anything obvious that I need to add to make this a pretty good starting point for lower level games. 

Any advice would be great, although I'd appreciate it if only bigger errors were pointed out as opposed to someone saying 40 and 70 is poor, and 45 and 75 makes more sense etc.

5507,I'll cut off my dick for the ability to use a regulated site. (Shit post FYI),poker,"\*Its been a few months.. and it's about that time that I make a shit post where I bitch about everything\*

&amp;#x200B;

To all my fellow US players getting fucked in the ass per usual... WHAT THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO DO TO USE A HONEST POKER SITE!?

&amp;#x200B;

It's 2021 and it has been almost a decade since I have been able to use a worthy-poker-site such as Full Tilt, Stars, 888, Party Poker, and so on. I am starting to fall out of love with poker because I can't keep playing on these bullshit sites located in Panama and throughout the Caribbean. Here are a couple of my experiences from the past 8-ish months or so.

&amp;#x200B;

ACR/WPN/BCP:

\-  2 to 4 months ago I received 2 PARTIAL refunds due to bots being at my table, in which one scenario was a final table. Didn't even get a full fucking refund. This also doesn't mention the other partial refunds I received earlier in 2020.

\- As you all well know, ACR has had multiple scandals going back to 2012, like the the 2018-2019 PLO/NL cash game bots and several people colluding together to take advantage of the late reg glitch. Nagy can eat a fat dick. 

\- If you play at America's Cardroom in 2021 you're a fucking retard. (No offence)

&amp;#x200B;

Betonline/BOL:

\- 6 months ago they removed $1000 from my poker balance on my account and said that the money was transferred to my sportsbook balance at 4am PST and all of it was spent in the online casino. When I asked them to investigate they did nothing. So I asked their Fraud/IT Department to send me a list of all devices, MAC addresses, and IP addresses that signed into my account that day... They refused to cooperate... Customer service said it was against company policy to release that  type of information, even though its MY OWN fucking account and personal information. ( I took a break from the site but eventually returned because US players have no options and I love MTTs.)

\- 2 months ago I deposited $50 of ETH to their sports book to bet on an NFL game. Blockchain.com confirmed that BOL's Etheruem address received my money, and I even sent customer service proof of the transaction THREE TIMES. They still refuse to issue me my $50 deposit to this day, stating ""our system says the deposit is still pending"".

\- 2 days ago I received a $5 refund from a Windfall Sit n Go because the 2 other two players at my table were bots :) :) :) I should just kill myself at this point. WHO THE FUCK HAS BOTS AT THE JACK POT SIT N GO.

&amp;#x200B;

Bovada/Ignition: 

\- Honestly, I haven't used them in like a year or two because they removed the chat box, make it a pain to utilize HUD software, and that fucking update they did to their software. That huge software update was so fucking horrible the sites damn near unplayable. I'm sure you guys remember the old canvas/layout that Bovada/Iggy use to utilize, it was way better.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't even want to play half the time because I'm sick of all the bullshit. I am also in Los Angeles, CA so the lockdown bullshit makes live poker a huge pain in the ass. Some casinos are open, some are closed, some are outside, some make you wear mask and sit in between plastic dividers, some allow you to order drinks but not food. It's all fucking stupid. I really want to use my VPN but I don't want to build up a bankroll on a legit site like PartyPoker and then have my funds frozen. Maybe I should just hang myself instead.

&amp;#x200B;

On a serious note, thank you for listening to me bitch and moan about my first world problems. I hope ya'll are happy, healthy and staying covid-free. Cheers to 2021, MAY THE POKER GODS BE IN YOUR FAVOR!",1609927467
5508,Possesed Poker Cards?,poker,"K this just a stupid story but at the time it fucked with my head, disturbed me. 

 I'm not a religious person, atheist in fact, don't believe in ghosts or stuff like that and thats probably why it disturbed me. Sidenote, everything was shuffled good, no fuckery, cut by the person to the right before dealt. 

 This game was only an 1 hour and half long with smoke breaks and distractions so not many hands played between 4 players.

 First hand of game is 63, limp pot, not sure who won.
 Couple hands go by, folds etc. 

 Couple hands go by m, nothing special. 

 Next Was dealt 66, flopped trips, won.

 Couple hands go by nothing out of the ordinary. 
  
  Dealt 33. Nothing special postflop.
  Dealt 33 again. Ha, that's funny. Flopped trips won. 

 Dealt 66, thats fuckin weird, nothing special happened postflop.

 Dealt 66 again. A hot flash comes over my face (anxiety) because I'm immediately spooked and i tell my friends afterwards about the fuckery that's going on. 

 Buddy is weirded out and says well hopefully it's not 66 again ,  cards are dealt out. 

 Motherfucker was 66. I knew it was gonna happen before it came.

 Fckin freaked me out. Didn't even play it, just showed my friends and everyone freaked the fuck out. , decided to keep my hand out of play and the flop came a six. 666 again. 

 At this point I didn't even fuckin care, throughout the game I had 63 atleast 5 times. Friend also flopped trip 66's (so glad it happened to him).

 For the record I won the home game, ran stupid good, but didn't care, just wanted to be done with the fuckin game. 

 Anyways, that's my dumb story, but a true dumb story, I don't know the statistics of that happening, but if people can win the lottery than this could happen easily without the assistance of demons.",1609926218

5514,Things to be careful of doing at a poker table,poker,"1. If you bust someone from a tournament with a worse preflop hand then them, be careful when you breathe after it happens because you're either already getting yelled at or the person is cool.

2. Don't win hands. This one is one of the most important, people don't like when you beat them because you didn't make the correct GTO play on every street.

3. You aren't allowed to have a good hand if someone didn't put you on that hand. Make sure to think in the other person's shoes how mad you would be if you thought someone had something and called and they didn't have it.

4. If you're under 25, you're gonna have a bad time. Don't be under 25. If you are under 25 atleast one  person is guaranteed to let you know, so save them the time and when you sit down at the table announce your age and say that you've never played before so they think you're really good and then just play however you want.",1609914436
5515,Relocating and live poker is a huge part of my decision on where to move to. Help me out a bit.,poker,So I am in Chicago right now and planning to relocate in the next few months. I was eyeing cheaper cost of living areas so many areas are out of the question like Vegas and CA. Southern Oregon has a few poker clubs open in Medford (which is quite cheaper than say Portland) and Iowa has some shit going as well. Any other places you fine folk might suggest that have live poker going and don't require more than $900 or so for a damn studio? I honestly don't care about the other amenities very much.,1609911248
5516,Playing in BBs instead of $ fixed my game,poker,"I don’t know if anyone else needs to hear this, but this one small piece of advice singlehandedly fixed my game and got me over the hump from NL5 to NL10. All I did was change my display from $ to in BBs. 

One of my biggest problems has been the shock factor of seeing bigger $ amounts when I try to move up stakes. I feel like I usually know in the back of my head what the right play is, but I don’t pull the trigger on that bluff or 3bet because it’s intimidating to me to put out that extra two dollars and maybe lose anyways. 

Now that I simply see BBs, that fear is gone. I literally don’t think about the actual money until I pull up my PT4. I simply focus on making the right plays, and it’s paying off tremendously. 

In my last 2 or 3 shots at NL10 I’ve lost big consistently. I’m only a few thousand hands into this shot but so far all my stats (and obviously results) are better than ever - better than I even was at lower limits. I’m confident that I’ll be a solid winner at the stake that I failed at so many times. 

Obviously this is still peanuts but I hope there’s someone else out there who can relate and maybe use this advice themselves.",1609910886

5522,Weird hand with 4flush and donking,poker,"Ignition 5NL Zone, 100bb effective

Hero opens CO to $0.15, BB calls.

**Flop (\~$0.31):** AdJd9c. BB check/calls $0.23.

**Turn (\~$0.75):** 8d. BB leads for $0.33.

**River (\~$1.38):** 2d (fourth diamond). BB bets $1.03.

How do you interpret BB's play here?

Turn almost seems like a block bet. At the very least, it doesn't seem very strong, unless BB has one of a few very invulnerable hands that really wants a call every time.

The river bet does not represent very much, I feel. I would expect to see a Kd/Qd flopped pair sometimes, but there aren't many of these. When I've looked up river bets on four-flush boards in the past, I've often been shown a low-to-mid diamond (pretty weird). Of course, there aren't many of these at all.",1609901267
5523,Sickest bad beat ever,poker,"So there I was, a .02/.05 table. I limped in UTG+1 with black Aces, you know, to disguise my hand. The whole table limps in. ""Perfect"", I think to myself, ""I got them right where I want them."" The flop runs out Jh8h5d, the SB bets, BB raises,  UTG 3-bets, I shove because Aces are still the best hand here in a 9-way pot. I mean you just can't fold a monster like that and I wasn't going to let some fish bluff me off the best hand in the game.

Button, SB, and BB all call. BB holds 10d9d, UTG holds two hearts, honestly can't even remember which cards or what Button holds because of how tilted I am that I continue to play on this rigged site. then the Q comes on the turn. I lose my stack. After grinding hours to get my bankroll up to $5, I lose it all with POCKET ACES.

5524,"Thoughts on ""Going North"" in Juicy 1/3 cash games with $500 cap?",poker,"I play at a casino that allows players to transfer their stack from one table to another when requesting a table change. So in a $500 cap game if you build your stack to $1k and change tables you are allowed to keep the $1k on the table. I realized that it would be extremely easy to go North in these games which are usually deep and very splashy.

Obviously this is against the casino rules but, is it really unethical to do such a thing? People break casino rules all the time at the poker table by folding out of turn when they have to take a piss or checking down the action when there is a multiway pot where one person is all in.

You've been invaluable over the past few days. I had two hands i wanted help with. I think if i can get this leak sorted i could really move up, (tilt dependent lol)

Anyways this is hand 1:

[https://upswingpoker.com/replayer/2a1PJ262](https://upswingpoker.com/replayer/2a1PJ262)

i kinda whiffed the flop i have two overs and a gutshot. In game i was thinking on this wet flop i should **just check fold**, the flop hits villains calling 3bet range much better (AT,JJ,99,88,QT). **Is that what i shouldve done?** On the turn, i continue barrelling on a blank. perhaps slightly questionable, i mean if he didnt fold flop why would he fold turn on a blank. On the river, i bet small, as i dont want to check fold. I definitely wanted to see his cards and what we had, curiosity got the better of me. I guess i should've jammed with zero showdown value, but he would've called me down with his TT blockers. What are your thoughts reddit?

&amp;#x200B;

Hand 2:

[https://upswingpoker.com/hand/?pokeit=7a1PJc1f](https://upswingpoker.com/hand/?pokeit=7a1PJc1f)

Again Isoraise limpers, (god i hate limpers), Im OOP so not loving life. Anyways, I bet on flop, thinking its a pretty dry board and im likely ahead. Sizing not great, but whatever its nl2. Fish calls, i bet again since SPR so low as hes a shorty. dont mind calling an all in with Ace high. He shows trips. 

&amp;#x200B;

Leak conclusion, i tend to hate facing bets when i check making me ultra punty and aggressive but i need to recognise that at times, check folding is best even with a good starting hand. Any thoughts to add reddit? What do solvers /GTO say about this? How do i stop people from  betting into me in this kinda line: (isoraise flop with premium cards, whiff flop check, villain bets (often big sizing due to isoraise preflop, i fold).",1609894558

I am going to share some of my ideas to be a good poker player and increase your chances of getting invited back to good games, and I hope some of y'all will share your ideas.

1. Never berate other players for their play (and certainly never berate a dealer).
2. If someone asks you what you think of their play, give your honest opinion in a nice manner.  People will play with stronger players so they can learn from them.  
3. Do not talk while other players are playing post-flop.  It disrupts people's ability to think.  And when you are in a hand, do not talk to your opponent unless they talk to you first.
4. If someone is steaming or tilting at the table, don't say anything.  Leave them alone.  We've all been there.
5. If an inexperienced player breaks the rules of poker etiquette, don't take it personally and brush it off.  Don't get upset.
6. Avoid any shady movements.  Don't reach for chips unless betting.  Use clear, concise language.
7. Keep chips and cards neat and visible so people know how much you are playing with and can see you are in the hand.
8. Don't get involved in disputes that have nothing to do with you.
9. If a decision needs to be made and it is EV neutral, let the other player choose (running it multiple times etc)
10. You don't have to socialize, but a nice disposition goes a long way :)",1609874832

5562,Definitive Guide: How To Win Every Single Hand In Poker - 2021,poker,"A quick disclaimer before we get into the guide: this only works for live poker. I am not responsible for any money you lose trying this online, I think we all should know by now that online poker is rigged. I also have never tried this as mommy would never let her good boi leave the house, but I'm pretty sure this is how it works.

&amp;#x200B;

So let's get to work...

&amp;#x200B;

PRE-FLOP:

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1: I've seen a lot of people get this crucial step wrong so pay close attention. Play every hand! Funny enough the first step in winning every hand is playing every hand. So you're going to be exclusively check / calling the pre-flop as you want as many people in the pot to pay you on the later streets.

&amp;#x200B;

FLOP:

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2: Flop trips. Pretty self-explanatory, I don't think I have to go into much detail. It should be pretty easy to flop trips in live games given the fact that even without playing pocket pairs you only have to hit 2 out of 3 cards so you even have some margin of error.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3: C-bet / call every option. You want to get the pot a little bigger without getting too many people to fold, more people in the pot = more money for you.

&amp;#x200B;

TURN:

&amp;#x200B;

Step 4: Improve to quads on either the turn or the river. This is essential for the master plan so don't forget this one. Again this shouldn't be too hard because you only have to hit one more card and you got 2 cards left, now that's a 50/50 percent chance if I've ever seen one. 

A lot of people tend to get worried if they haven't already gotten their quads on the turn. Idk why they think their chances of hitting them get smaller when in fact you're GUARENTEED to get to quads on the river if you haven't on the turn. You see the math here is simple, on either street you either improve to quads or you don't and that means there's only one option left for the river as you have already missed the turn.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 5: You're again going to be disguising the strength of your hand by betting small aprox. third of the pot / calling your options. They won't know what hit them on the river.

&amp;#x200B;

RIVER:

&amp;#x200B;

Step 6: So you're sitting with quads on the river, it's time to take this pot home. A lot of times you're going to be holding the nuts here, but if there's a possibility that a better hand exists refer to step 7. If not, shove all in and say : ""Ooh, I hope nobody calls me"" while trying to look as scared as possible. It's reverse psychology, I've seen the pros do it on TV. This guarantees that you'll get called.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 7: So there's a possibility that you don't have the nuts? Outrageous, keep in mind that it's still possible to rig a live game so after you win this hand be sure to switch tables. Now we're going to have to bluff this one, which means shoving all in. Some people might be asking how are you going to get the nuts to fold with just moving all in? This is where the tricky part comes you have to raise with your soul.  This usually gets the villain to fold but if he's still considering calling be sure to also bet your mother's souls as you light up a cigarette, mommy doesn't let me smoke though so you might have to improvise here.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it, I mathematically solved poker for you guys, no need to thank me! Just remember to repeat these exact steps in this exact order for the next hand and we'll all beat the casinos.",1609867320
5563,Any other Christian poker players?,poker,"I am interested in your thoughts on how you rationalize and continue to play poker as a Christian because lately I've been struggling with this. Especially with the pandemic and the casino being closed it's given me a lot of time to reflect on things. And what I found was a lot of shame for winning money from other people to the point I felt I needed a true genuine confession. To my surprise the priest defended me and said as long as I wasn't taking time away from my family and wasn't indulging in too much gambling that it wasn't a problem. I was also surprised because I went into my confession ready to donate all my winnings but he said to only donate 10 percent. I'm still having a tough time with that one as I can't shake this shame. And if I do play poker again I don't feel right only donating 10 percent. I think mentally I've settled on 30-40 percent but that even makes me feel shame. 

I don't want to offend anyone here who disagrees with my views on poker so I apologize if anyone thinks I'm shaming their life choices. I'm only hear judging myself looking for advice from other poker players who are Christians and how they rationalize poker and any shame they feel.",1609866649

I Brought a hand aswell, the one i mouseover in the picture, although i will remove some of the text to save space and also its not relevant.

Hero (CO): $18.55 (371 bb)

Pre Flop: (pot: $0.07) Hero has Kh Jc

Alright so my question is, simply, what am i supposed to do with the ""all-in adj diff"" stat? when i mouseover it, it says this

**Difference between actual and adjusted net won amount based on expected all-in winnings in hand currency**

i have absolutely no idea what to make of that, it doesnt mean anything when i read it, when i look at -0.93% while i had 90.9% equity when i shoved.

Same goes for the hand above it in the picture, a shitshow of a hand where i decide to x/r all-in on the turn &gt;!because im an idiot!&lt;, the all-in adj diff gives me -6.42$ while i had 47.6% as played in a 3way pot, which is ahead. They both snap called if anyone cares, set of 8's and a gutshot

5570,A Mental Hand History - Learning to Fold,poker,"Hey all, bit of a long post here. I'm doing a little mental hand history as per the recommendation of Jared Tendler in his book The Mental Game of Poker. The idea is to improve a flaw in my game, in this case overcalling river spots. Thought I'd share my process as it will help me to do so, and maybe others. If not, I don't think I'm doing any harm. If you have comments, corrections, additions, I'm interested to hear them as always.

I start by naming the problem. Then questioning what mental reasoning/emotional ties create that problem. Then for each of those, I work out the flawed logic underpinning it. Finally, I create a few key statements to refer back to. This time I really dug deep, because I think the problem merited it. So without further ado..

**The problem:**

I call with hands I know I should fold on the river against opponents who are unlikely to be bluffing.

**The reasons:**

1) I am attached to the strength of my hand.

\-&gt; *Hand strength is relative to all five board cards and the opponent's range. It changes with every street, and with every action by the opponent. Simple example: TT starts as a relatively strong hand, but changes in relative strength the moment someone cold 4bets. More complex example: AsJh on board Ac 3c 9s 5c 8d. Villain checks turn and overbets river. My hand is relatively strong when he checks, but when he overbets, it's strength suddenly polarizes.*

2) I am attached to the size of the pot, the bigger the pot, the harder the fold.

\-&gt; *The size of the pot has no bearing on whether or not I have odds to call, the decision should be based on pot odds and the information I have available. If anything, the relative strength of a Villain's hand increases with their bet size and the size of the pot. Even though this shouldn't be case, it generally IS.*

3) I want to see the opponents cards to see if I was right/wrong

*-&gt; Being ""right"" in Poker is not about knowing exactly which two cards an opponent is holding. It's about knowing what their entire range is, and whether or not you had odds to call. Calling and seeing a hand shows you one tiny part of their range, and doesn't tell you whether you were right or wrong to call.*

4) I want to see my opponents cards because I would rather lose and know, than never know at all

*-&gt; That's the game ;) But seriously, we can find another way to ""know"", which is to see their aggression on various streets using the HUD, and eventually gather enough information to make those calls when it makes sense to do so. Also, we already know! The pool underbluffs, and we can determine their range on that basis. The range is what we (should) care about, not whether they have or don't have a specific part of their range.*

5) I don't like the feeling of being bluffed

*-&gt; No one does! However, opponents are actually unlikely to be bluffing. If they are bluffing and I fold a better hand, that's credit to their ability and is part of the game. I am only being exploited if I am being bluffed more often than I am being value bet. I am exploiting the opponent by overfolding, and denying them value. When they exploit that fact and begin bluffing huge pots, I can think logically about counter adjusting if it makes sense to do is. At the moment it is far me likely I am being targeted/exploited for overcalling, and opponents may even be betting larger sizes because they know I am likely to call!*

6) I feel frustrated that I got so far into a hand with something marginal, and don't want to cut my losses

*-&gt; Betting or calling with marginal hands is done because they have enough equity or future fold equity to do so. That doesn't mean their equity or fold equity is always going to materialize. They should only materialize a certain percentage of the time, probably less often than I believe. Both of those types of equity can also change in an instant.* 

7) My thought process is halted by the emotionally charged nature of big pots

*-&gt; This relates to Unconscious Competence. I haven't practiced enough hand reading to be able to do it even when I am under stress, meaning it is not yet an Unconscious Competence. Meaning: More study needed off-felt for river decisions especially.*

8) ""Its only x amount more to call, and I can win the whole pot!"" - thinking this would somehow avoid losing what I have already put in

*-&gt; Money/chips were put in the pot as a bet on equity. The second that bet is made, that money is gone and a new round of betting takes place. The decision is equity vs. pot odds, nothing else. Also.. in a vaccuum, folding is actually a 0EV decision. No matter how many times I catch someone bluffing, the fact of doing so may have been -EV anyway.*

9) I think the opponent will overbet as a bluff because I do that myself

*-&gt; Everyone thinks differently. Part of the skill of Poker is using empathy to understand the thought process of other players. Underbluffing makes a lot of sense. Not everyone is rolled properly. Most people don't hedge their bets on an opponent folding to a large sizing when they have nothing, especially when they been burnt before by opponents who station them with 3rd pair! It is very hard to make big bets as a bluff that are +EV in the long run but feel terrible the times they are called. Most people are not capable of doing it even if they know it is correct. Its possible thats the reason they are playing the stakes they are and haven't moved up.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Short term: Logic injections**

Hand strength changes with each action.

Decisions should be made using odds vs equity.

We are interested in range, not specific hands. 

You're not being bluffed, you're being exploited for value.

Is it scary to bluff for this player on this board?

**Long term:**

Study more river spots to make decisions and hand reading an Unconscious Competence.

Recognize which of these emotions/thought processes are occurring every time I'm in a hand and make a bad call on the river. Write them down after the hand.

Anticipate that a stressful river decision may be approaching every time I reach the turn.",1609860240
5571,Mental game issues,poker,"I am in an extreme downswing right now (I have a good winrate over around 140k hands online), but I just haven't won a single session in the last like 8 sessions. This is causing me to make bad decisions at the table. For example, was playing live yesterday and I'm folding all day and all of a sudden I get pocket AA, finally I'm playing in a $300 game which is way bigger than I normally play, I got aces, maybe I can win a nice pot (yes I know I am not bankrolled, but I just find live so much more fun so I play the lowest stake I can lol). Raise from HJ, Btn and SB call. Flop is 994 and I check since I don't really need protection and cant really get value from anything worse (note I'd bet pairs worse than AA), and Btn bets, SB calls and I should've just folded right there, I don't think I'm good here. But I'm like ""I waited too long to fold aces"". I end up calling small value bets all 3 streets and of course he had the 9, and I knew it. I even said at the table ""there's nothing you can be bluffing with here"" and I made the crying call like a fish, I knew I was no good. 

Anyone experience this? Widening your range and making calls you know you shouldn't be making, just as a result of losing for so long? To top off the night, I got AA v KK all in pre and he flopped a set, but obviously I couldn't do anything there",1609860098
5572,Where to live as an online grinder? (Europe),poker,"Hey guys, having recently started my journey as a poker-pro, it’s very easy to start think about where you could be and where you want to be. Currently I’m an online-grinder living in the UK - making enough money to pay the bills and the rent, and to eat substantial enough meals - gravy, right? (If you pardon the, albeit intentional, pun). And the truth is, it is gravy. I’m loving getting better and better at this whacky and wild game that I love and being able to live a life playing it! Long may that continue. 
But I’ve started dreaming a little bigger. Dreaming of moving out somewhere in Europe and living with other grinders like myself. Currently one of the drawbacks of being where I am is living with people who have far more... let’s say ‘orthodox’ lifestyles when compared with mine. So basically what I was wondering is was two things:
A) Are there people out there like me, in their twenties, doing this poker thang, and thinking about the next steps in their path - and perhaps the idea of living with other pros?
And B) Where in Europe is the best place to live as a poker pro. Does anyone here have any experience of such a thing? England is obviously great and, I mean, as a British man, it’s just... fine... init? But I’ve never really been away from it and have dreams of renting (or even one day buying) in, say, Amsterdam or Vienna... is this a crazy thought? Is this often done? And how hard would it be to, say, move to Amsterdam and just grind MTTs?

I have a fulltime job and fortunately money isnt a issue right now. The 5k I just lost was actually from an upswing I had turning a deposit of 50 into 5k at 50NL, 100NL, 200NL.

But the real issue to me is this poker friend that I have, he has gambling issues of his own. He lost 40k in blackjack at the end of 2019 and hasnt been playing since then. Says he is now off the addiction and is saving up money to build a roll. But I feel like his true test will come when the pandemic is over.

Now the problem is he keeps giving me free advise about how I should conduct myself related to poker. That I shouldnt play for a while, or not play online at all etc. Curiously all his advise comes right after I have a downswing. When I am on an upswing he has no issues.

It just feels to me that he is being hypocritical when he says I should not have done that, that I should be more careful about money. We have been friends for 4 years now. And this seems to happen often. For example he advises me to play less poker and then he just plays like a 48 hour session of live poker and claims ""the action was good"", also there was a period of 30 days when he went to the casino everyday.

It is tough to listen to someone go off and advise you on things which they dont seem to follow themselves. I have told him as much and he says me calling him a hypocrite wont help and that instead I should take his advise and get better. This leads to arguments and I feel like I should say goodbye to this poker friendship.

Turn is a 7 and then he fires $60, this is the spot I think I can fold but I just decide to call and fold to a river bet (maybe he's overplaying KT or doing something stupid with middle pair? Unknowns at 1/3 do all sorts of weird stuff. I'm really not loving this though).

River is a Q and he bets about pot and I snap it off (now I beat KJ which is plausible), and he actually had AT that rivered the nuts. I'm not really going to be results oriented here (obviously I know I can't fold if he had AT), and I know I can't fold river. The question is the turn.

*fold*, MP calls 1 BB, CO raises to 4 BB, *fold*, **Hero raises to 15 BB**, *fold*, *fold*, CO calls 11 BB

This is a clear 3-bet. I think 16 BB is slightly better but I like being cheeky with my sizings sometimes.   


Flop (32 BB, 2 players):  
 Qs7s7c  
**Hero bets 10 BB**, CO raises to 20 BB, **Hero calls 10 BB**

This flop I bet often. I have all the overpairs, top pair,  and the only possible full house here. Villain has quads (I guess) and tons of random middling pairs. You can argue for a slightly larger sizing but when range betting I like to go smaller. I like to get lots of cheap folds with hands like AK or AQ that miss the flop fairly often. The problem comes when I get minraised. The raise isn't quite large enough to fold too but it also makes me fairly cautious because you can't exactly be raising much on a board like this. Maybe a flush draw bluffs here but I block most of them with Ks and unblock trips. I'm very rarely going to be good after calling this raise, and even if I hit a K or A I might be in bad shape....I decide to call here and reevaluate on the turn.   


Turn (72 BB, 2 players):  
 4c  
**Hero checks**, CO bets 34.2 BB, ***fold***

Most turns are a blank like this so most turns I'm gonna have to fold. I don't like calling the flop just to fold most turns, but is the sizing too small to fold to? Also I debated turning AK into a bluff on the flop but wasn't quite sure if that was the right move. Sure villain's range is mostly middling pairs but idk if I can get those to fold on the flop especially with a flush draw possible. Thoughts on my play?

This is an easy 3-bet but CO 4-bets a bit large. Against a sizing like this I can definitely fold a lot more often but I prefer calling TT for the implied odds.   


Flop (60.4 BB, 2 players):  
Js4s3s  
**Hero checks**, CO bets 34.8 BB, **Hero raises to 69.6 BB**, CO raises to 74.6 BB and is all-in, **Hero calls 5 BB**

Besides flopping a set this is one of the better flops for me. I debate betting or checking but decide to check and hopefully hit my flush. In retrospect this was kinda stupid. Villain probably isn't 4-betting AJs  or JJ with this sizing very often but they're gonna have a lot of overpairs and some flopped flushes. They probably aren't folding overpairs on the flop but I can discourage shoves by donking here. I feel like 1/3 donk here would buy me a cheap turn and protect me from overpair shoves that deny me tons of equity.   


Anyway I check and villain goes half pot. My options here are basically shove or fold. I could call here but the SPR allows villain to bluff pretty much any turn with a flush draw. I leaned towards shoving because....I am not quite sure. Villain could easily have a stronger flush here (possible but unlikely)  or a pair+draw here than absolutely dominates my TT. I'm not quite sure what a shove here accomplishes  besides punting money against a range that is 9/10 stronger than mine. On the other hand TT is pretty much the top of my range here and if I'm folding TT I'm folding everything but JJ. All in all I'm not quite sure what the correct move was here....thoughts?

Haven’t been in many 5bet NAI situations and got pretty lost here. 

Preflop I assumed very tight range AA, KK, QQ, and AKs and some frequency of JJ / TT / 99 and AKo, but that could be one of my mistakes.

Assuming that range, I’m beating JJ, TT, and AK. (18 combos), losing to (11). Freerolling KK.

Had no time left in the time bank, so only had about 15 seconds to decide, seemed like a fairly under-bluffed spot, so I folded but didn’t feel great about it. Might be a terrible fold getting great odds, but my default in the micros was to overfold to aggression so I stuck with it here. 

After having thought about it for a bit, I’m leaning towards calling the 4bet to play a smaller pot in position and can get more info post flop. 

Some questions: 
- What does a SB 5bet calling range is 200bb deep?
- Thoughts preflop?

More than anything I'd really appreciate a systematic way to eradicate this from my game, rather than some magic pill words of advice. Basically.. a game plan to work on day by day, where each day I get gradually better. Perhaps by creating my own rewards system, or doing a particular mental exercise that improves that faculty?

The most common way this manifest itself is in hands where I instinctively feel I shouldn't be calling, but instead of thinking through the decision, I'll skip the thought process, almost as if I can't face hearing the ""bad news"" that calling is a terrible option once I've thought it all through.

Looking at [https://www.pokerscout.com/](https://www.pokerscout.com/), I see that Partypoker is all but dead and Pokerstars isn't as dominating as it once was. here are my questions:

What is your opinions on GGPoker? I remember I used to play on it and it was very soft, but the player pool still wasn't even on the level of 888. I quit because there was clearly something suspicious about the rakeback system. I will be the first one to call all those people who say the site is rigged every they lose a hand morons, but I did the math and the odds that I get the worse rakeback bracket as many times in a row as I did if the odds were as advertise were worse than the odds of me winning the lottery. Is this still the case? Is the player pool still dogshit? Is the player pool somewhat consistent (I know that it is mostly for Asian players)

Are there any other sites you would recommend right now. What I like is winning. Which means that my priority are, in this order: big enough player base, soft games, good UI, zoom variant available.

People only go all in on the flop with such a tiny pot when they got the absolute nuts or they're just tilted as hell. Villain's shoving range is probably AK+ although I block AK so more likely KT+. I highly doubt villain is shoving here with KQ although maybe they do idk. I think with the absurdly large SPR I can afford to fold everything but sets right? Or is folding an overpair on the flop too nitty? AA becomes pretty much a bluff catcher and a pretty bad one since I unblock all of villain's sets.

5760,How Much of Poker is Skill and How Much is Luck?,poker,"Most poker players, whether he is new in playing poker or playing for a long time, have a question- is poker a game of skill or a game of chance? 

Poker is a game of 100% skill in the longer run. However, there is a small part of luck in this game. Professional players cover up the luck value by making mathematical decisions to win in the longer run. Here, you will know why luck is needed to win in a poker game and how skill plays an important role. 

Whether you are playing poker for fun or playing [**real money poker**](https://www.pokerdangal.com/real-money-poker), it is played against other people and not the house. Everyone says that the house always wins, so you already know that when you are playing the game against the house, you will never win. So, you should have enough skills to win the game. It is a game of mathematics and odds. 

**Winning the poker game is a consistent application of the following strategy-**

You have to get more money in the poker pot, which is an added advantage, and when you have less money in the pot, you have a disadvantage. Bluffing in poker is a skill, and you should excel in that to win poker. However, if you want to bluff, you should keep in mind to control the movements and hands of opponent players. Bluff is a very good way to win the game unless your opponents do not find out that you ate bluffing. 

Though people think that luck is needed, but not in a large way, the type of cards you are receiving is a matter of luck, but the rest is a full skill.",1609740014
5761,Homegames online?,poker,My home game has been seriously disrupted by COVID etc.  A group of about 20 friends including myself had a monthly game with usually  8 - 10 people joining and it was something to look forward to. Some players are hard core players who play online and in tourneys etc. and others are casual who just play once a month.  Our game was fun and social.  ...anyway we tried to take it online using Pokerstars and Zoom with someone acting as a banker with Venmo and Paypal.  Pokerstars reallllly sucks for home games since it just wants to move the game forward with timers etc.  Having  a conversation and  a casual game seems pretty impossible.   ...anyway that was a long winded background to my question.

I'll provide some shoddy thoughts and considerations, but I want to hear better ones. Please try to provide your analysis rather than critique mine. I know it's incomplete and it's much harder to add value and make money than it is to critique, just like in poker. 

Some thoughts...

What Trump is likely playing to win:

 - 4(+) more years of the Presidency

 - A political dynasty akin to the Bush's, Kenneys, or Clintons for his sons, daughters, and their families

 - A favorable position for business dealings for himself and his family

 - Fame and notoriety

What Trump is risking:

 - Time

 - Reputation and family reputation

 - Prison or his life if he breaks or has been breaking any laws in trying to keep the election

Strengths and weaknesses against his opponent, Joe Biden:

 - Strength: he's already in office. He needs to find a way to stay, that's it. 

 - Weakness: there's no precedent in the USA for what he's doing. All precedents favor him losing office

 - Most other obvious strengths and weaknesses seem to approximately cancel, be up for dispute, or boil down to the two above so I'll just leave it at that

BB wins 210.62 BB

&amp;#x200B;

My instinct was to say I got coolered, and the money just goes in whatever happens. But I guess it comes down to whether or not I can give Villain AKo and/or AQo as a triple barrel, and if so, how many combos. If not, I basically beat zero hands other than missed club draws. When played, I thought V could have them. Now I realize its probably more nuanced than that.

My guess would be that all combos of AKo and AQo cbet the dry flop, combos with As or Ac barrel turn, and river..

I think my hand is fairly face up by that point. Seems like I can basically have QQ and TT, with some club draws that I haven't raised, and sometimes spade draws (that Villain blocks, though I'm not to know that). So in theory that might tempt AKo and AQo to shove, but something tells me I might be way off. In practice, are my opponents at that stake really shoving river with bluffs when I look for all the world like I'm calling? That's the subjective part, I suppose.

Curious to hear other people's opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

My instinctive calculation is..

Hands I beat: 7 combos of AKo, 3 combos of AQ

Hands that beat me: AKss, AQss, AJss, 3 combos of JJ, 1 combo 99 (maybe), one or two more AXss 

\~10 combos I beat, \~10 combos that beat me, giving me the right odds to call.

Everyone, their grandma, their uncle, their little sister Jess, the mailman next door all unanimously decide to contribute 30 cents and their last 6 braincells to the communist pot. Maybe they had pocket aces and wanted to.....trap? And then get a ""bad beat"" and rant on r/poker. Maybe they predicted that their 85o was finally gonna flop a full house or their pocket 2s were gonna hit quads. Or maybe some quantum atom decided to split off 2 milliseconds to the left instead of the right setting off a chain reaction that prevented every single person from raising . Nobody except the poker gods know that answer. But what I do know is, in a pot where everyone calls I can't exactly be raising my 98s. I decide to call and realize some of my implied odds, hope for a flopped straight or trips or flush or full house to hit payday and get the fuck out if I hit 2 pair or less because I was goddam sure at least someone there was gonna spike a set.   


Flop (36 BB, 6 players):  
 7s4s3s  
SB checks, BB checks, **Hero bets 14 BB**, MP raises to 92.6 BB and is all-in, *fold*, *fold*, *fold*, BB raises to 101.6 BB and is all-in, **Hero calls 59.4 BB and is all-in**

I decide to bet into 3 people with a flopped flush....that was my first mistake. In normal poker a flopped flush is basically the nuts. But when there's a 6 way pot that equity drops to like what, 55%?? At the time I was so worried about getting it all in before AsKd hit the nut flush that I forgot this was literally a 6 way pot and at least 1 person is gonna be shoving here.  The correct move was probably to let someone else shove first and then stack off some random set or 2 pair that thought they were good. Leading doesn't really accomplish anything here but throw away chips if I later decide folding the flop is the right option (I can't believe there is actually a spot where folding a flush on the flop might be the right move). 

So it starts off fine with one person shoving. I think to myself ""Cool he either has As or some overpair stupidly shoving for protection or maybe a set that's too retarded to see that in a 6 way pot there's no way any set is good"". Predictably 3 people fold but then BB decides to shove all in. This is when I have to pause. This man just shoved all in after some other guy shoved all in. Maybe one of them has a flush? Maybe one of them has a stronger flush than my flush? Or maybe they're both equally retarded? In normal circumstances if you folded 98s multiway on the flop you would be called an idiot rightfully so. But after this action, and with literally 6 people in this hand I think the right move was to fold. I think the person that calls after this action is an idiot. And that idiot was me.

SB posts SB 0.4 BB, **Hero posts BB 1 BB**  


**Dealt to Hero:**  
 9d5d  


UTG calls 1 BB, CO calls 1 BB, *fold*, *fold*, **Hero checks**

I get to see the flop for free. Why not.   


Flop (3.4 BB, 3 players):  
 KdTh4d  
**Hero checks**, UTG checks, CO bets 3.4 BB, **Hero calls 3.4 BB**, *fold*

I remember the bet being smaller in the moment, but I have a flush draw and likely high implied odds if villain is pumping in the money with top pair.   


Turn (10.2 BB, 2 players):  
 9c  
**Hero checks**, CO bets 9.8 BB, **Hero calls 9.8 BB**

Turn bet is extremely large but I hit a pair. I think this gives me enough equity to call but not quite enough to raise. Was I wrong here? Was the turn bet a clear fold?   


River (29.8 BB, 2 players):  
 4h  
**Hero checks**, CO bets 28.4 BB, ***fold***

I miss everything on the river and villain barrels large again. Obviously I fold.

5828,Poker and Mostly Related NYR,poker,"Fairly new to Reddit, but don't let that discourage you from making disparaging comments.  

I live in Las Vegas and I'm a 'professional' poker player.  'Professional' is in quotes, because I'm not famous now--and I have no interest in becoming famous.  I'm primarily a Live NL200/NL500 player originally from the sticks in Oklahoma.  I've lived in several places over the years (OK, IN, NY, AZ, NV, California, Japan, *et al*) so *Oklahoma* was more of a phase than a traditional hometown.  I'm in Vegas proper now, having moved up from Laughlin about 9 months ago (was commuting prior to that).  

Last year I had all these changes I was going to make, but I lacked the proper planning and didn't execute anywhere near my ambition or ability.  This year I'm taking a different approach and focusing a lot more on time management and discipline.  I run, what has to be the worst poker blog on the Internet, and my 2021 Crush List™ is located [here](https://villainfolds.com/2020/12/30/2021-crush-list/).  Most of the items on the list are directly or indirectly motivated by my poker ambitions--as well as the entirety of the blog.  On that note--

Like I said, I'm fairly new to Reddit, **but** unlike 90% of end-users--I read the rules.  The blog doesn't sell anything and there are **no advertisements** (excepting the WordPress logo in the footer).  I've also posted more than 10 times in r/poker and, in my opinion, at least some of those contributed value.

Finally, I was a Marine for about 9.5 years, a really long time ago.  That's not a #HumbleBrag.  It does mean that you don't have to worry about offending me, regardless of what you say--I'm not a touchy-feely hippy.  It also means that you can expect cleverish and potentially offensive retorts in direct correlation.

5852,So how would you have played this hand?,poker,"Yes I typed it out b/c I don't have a program to compile it for me.

$0.25 6h turbo SNG. 

Still 6 players, I have 1245, blinds are 50/100, I'm UTG with KK, I limp. Reasoning is that I've been fairly tight and I don't want to scare everyone out of the pot with a raise from UTG, and very often people make large raises from late position to prey on  tight short stacks limping with marginal hands. After which raise I shove, and they're priced into calling if they have an ok hand. And getting all my money in is my goal with KK and 12 BB.

&amp;#x200B;

Button, SB, and BB limp, flop comes Q87 rainbow. Checked to me, I bet 250 into 400 because I want to thin the field a bit. Button calls, SB/BB fold. Now would be a good time to state that my impression of button is that he's a pretty standard player, which is to say good for this stakes.

&amp;#x200B;

Turn is another 8. At this point I've got 895 behind and 900 in the pot. Now at this point I elected to use my brain. I figured that his range of hands that limp preflop and call the flop is something like A8, A7, QJ, QT, T9, and small possibility of 77 or 88, although I think it's likely he would raise preflop with those. There's other hands that he could have that I beat like AQ, but they would have raised preflop, or re-raised the flop. Given those hands I figure that I'm best off still trying to get all my chips in the pot since I only lose to the A8 or the smaller chance of 77 or 88. So I opt to check, given that it only takes one more bet to get all my chips in, and there's another chance. There's also the slim chance that I might fold the river if he checks behind and an A comes on the river. He bets 100, and I kind of have to call or re-raise. I opt to call, mostly because the small bet size spooked me. But really, spooked or not, I still feel pretty committed.

&amp;#x200B;

River is another Q. Now I lose to more hands, the A7 will no longer call anything, and the T9 will fold to any bet, and if I check my bluff me. I decided that I really don't like my spot because it seems like anything that calls anything I bet has me beat. The alternative is checking, in which case he's very likely to bluff even if he has nothing, since he has about 1k more than me, and he will also have noticed that I've been fairly tight. I elect to shove since it feels like my chips are going in the middle no matter what, and shoving at least requires that he actually have me beat to win, which he may not. Bear in mind that if I check/fold I've got 7BB left and probably need to double up twice to have a reasonable chance at making the money, and I won't see many hands b/c turbo. He calls and has A8.

&amp;#x200B;

At what points would you do something differently? Should I have just raised preflop with KK? Should I have gone for the hero fold on the river when he inevitably bet?",1609654661

**Preflop:** Hero LJ ($5.12) opens to $0.15 with AJdd, BU ($5.39) raises to $0.45, only hero calls.

**Flop (\~$0.95): Ac4hTc.** Hero checks, BU bets $0.47, hero calls.

**Turn (\~$1.89): 9s.** Check, check.

**River (\~$1.89): 8c.** Hero bets $0.66.

River play depends a bit on what hands we actually continue preflop and on the flop (KJs, QJs, ATs are somewhat standard but probably a bit suspect against this particular pool). On the river, we have few bluffs, a lot of hands with some value, and few really nutted hands (mostly capped at TT), although BU is likely similarly capped after checking this turn.

This block bet probably runs into AK-AQ sometimes, but shouldn't get raised, and may sneak some calls out of KK-JJ or occasional smaller aces.

If we want to go more polarized on this river, then AJs is clearly not strong enough; in fact, may be a check/fold if we fill the cbet/check/bet line is underbluffed. Thoughts on playing this river?",1609641079

A percentage of each tourney's prize poll will be put aside and the 3 people with the most points at the end of the series will get to split up the side pot.

He did drink a little more than me but I was also drinking a lot. About 10 drinks for me and 12-15 for him. 

He initially said we needed a “stop/loss” and he insisted on 3k, to which I said I would want to continue to keep playing if I was down, set my stop/loss at 8k. 

Once he hit his stop loss, he asked if it was cool to rebuy, to which I asked if he was sure he wanted to rebuy because we were at his loss and also asked how long he wanted to continue for. He said yes he was sure and he wanted to continue for “an hour”. 

I then stack him again and he asks to rebuy and we have the same conversation and it goes the same exact way. 

This continues to the end when he finally asks how much I owe, I count my stack and he is baffled, saying he had no clue he was in for that much and asked for a “deal”. 

Also, we have played for a long time together in private games. Have played heads up numerous times for 6+ hour sessions each. We have never once had issue with paying out. 

Most that has been payed out before between each other was ~8k

We have drank before during other sessions but this was definitely the most drunk we have been.

However, when playing I realize I don't think anymore. All my actions are instinctive. I don't look at other player's tendencies and just zone out when I'm not in the hand. I don't think about ranges, nothing. Just pay people off with decent hands, value bet decent hands, not changing sizing or thinking about anything.

I tend to triple barrel bluff and i'm pretty sure its costing me a fuck ton of winnings. I find that players who dont fold turn wont fold river on any sizing, but there are times when one final bullet does the trick so I always play the guessing game. Anyways here's a hand in which i lost out on and I would love for you to critique: 

\-Game: 7 handed

\-Villain 1: nit with VPIP of 14% limps for 1bb

\-Hero: HJ AcTc raise to 4bb (standard)

\-folds around

\-Villain 2: Button (passive reg) 23/17/8.2 decent player calls (

\-Folds around including Villain 1.

\-100 bb effective stacks HU flop comes  4c3d9d. I cbet 50% 5bb, Villain calls,

\-turn is 5d.  I bet bigger 13.5bb or (60%). Villain calls

\-river is a 2c  i jam all in for 83.5bb. He calls. I muck he shows 6c7c

What the hell did i do wrong here? I maybe got too greedy withthe river jam perhaps..But is there anything else i need to be thinking about? What are the golden rules to triple barrelling like this?

Some of them would make more money working fast food than playing full time poker. And the money that they posted has not been taxed (depending on country off course) or doesn't include the cost of food , clothing,  gas,rent, mortgage, health insurance monthly etc.

Off course there are rare exceptions to this. 

I grew up watching online players like Annette_15 (she won the wsop main event and was considered one of the best online players ) she recently released a YouTube video and she says that she stopped playing poker because she just wasn't making any money from it and it was a lot harder. 

I remember that Bencb (considered one of the top coaches and players) opened up about his earnings and he breaks down what he made and it was a lot less than i expected.

Brynkenny the top money maker in tournament poker says that the hogh stakes circuit cost 5 million a year to play. Which means many people would need at to win 5million a year just to make more than $1.  He said himself (Joey podcast) that he has gone broke or was in make up many times.

Also when the high stakes gg poker cash games became popular last year that many well known regs lost there bankrolls.
(Nikita said this in another podcast on youtube) 

If you watch the top top high stakes players on twitch who play online (1k $500 5k , 10k , $200) they are spending multiple bullets in each tournament. Sometimes 3 or 4 bullets in 5k and 1k and even 10ks. If they make the final table (top 3)  they break even for the day!   The majority of online poker twitch  streamers make  -0 for the day.

I played for a couple months and never really improved my knowledge of the game, even after putting in some serious hours I never felt like I’d gotten better at the game since those first few weeks. I’d go deep in small online tournaments but lose concentration once pressure situations came around, and due to work I took a few months away from poker since I didn’t have the time anymore.

Now I’m back playing again but I find myself exactly where I left off. I don’t really know how to further my skillset (what little I have) and generally feel as though I’m being outclassed by other players. Obviously, I’m playing micro stakes here so I’m not coming up against the best around but it’s a little frustrating nonetheless.

Normally I would just fold here but villain has been  REALLY aggressive  over the past several hands and is probably a capable reg that can bluff smart (anybody this aggressive that isn't an spewy aggrotard probably is). Maybe villain has just gotten luckbox after luckbox but I'm willing to call down here. Theoretically I just fold here right? Villain has too many nutted hands. I guess you can argue that KQ is probably the best possible bluffcatcher here because of all the blockers (although it does block flush draws too) but I think this board is too dynamic to be calling. Am I wrong?

This is a standard open.   


Flop (6.4 BB, 2 players):  
 9s6h2h  
BB checks, **Hero bets 3.2 BB**, BB calls 3.2 BB

Decently good flop for me. Theoretically I should be betting small and often but a weak overpair like TT needs protection from overcards that might come on later streets, so I thought a slightly larger bet wouldn't be horrible.,   


Turn (12.8 BB, 2 players):  
 9d  
BB checks, **Hero checks**

The turn pairs the board which is kind bad. Villain will have some 9x after calling the flop so I opt to check call any reasonable bet and reevaluate on the river. It goes check check.   


River (12.8 BB, 2 players):  
 Th  
BB bets 10 BB, **Hero raises to 114 BB and is all-in**, *fold*

This is the best river card I can ask for, a lot of villain's range just hit the flush and I can stack pretty much all of villain's 9x here. I debate whether to go for a large raise or just to shove, but decide shoving is better because villain will be calling me off a lot if their river bet wasn't a bluff. Was this a mistake? Would a 3x raise/minraise here be better?

5928,I would like to know what you think please. What's the right thing to do in this situation?,poker,"This isn't really about the poker hand itself or about how I should have played it.  This is about what happens at the end of a hand after I go all-in on the River.  

So here's the setup:

I was playing 1-3 NLH at the casino on a Saturday morning.  I'm in the 6 seat and Villain is in the 9.  The table has 9 players.

The table plays a couple orbits and I've not been too involved deep into any hands.  I can only tell a little about Villain at this point.  He is \~75yo, probably European based on his accent, and he uses table talk liberally while in a hand as a part of his game.  He's clearly not a calling station or a maniac based on what I've seen.

The hand starts and we're \~$375 effective.  I'm in the LoJack with 10s9s.  I open to $15 pre-flop which has been standard for the table.  Action folds to the Villain who calls on the button and BB calls. 

The flop is 4d-8c-Js.  I bet my open ended backdoor flush draw for $25 and Villain calls.  BB folds.  Pot is $89 after rake.

Turn is 5s.  I continue with a $75 turn bet setting up a river shove whether I hit or not and Villain calls.  Pot is $239.  

River is 4d.  I go all-in as there's no way I win at showdown and he hasn't shown any strength.  Must be a marginal made hand I think.  

Now for the fun part:  

Villain goes into the tank.  He's holding his cards, looking at them, and starts doing some of his table talk.  He's watching me carefully for any reaction and so I sit still, staring at the wall and let him do his talking.  After a couple minutes he holds out his cards, kinda level and face down, looks right at me and says, ""ok, I give it to you"".

He doesn't make any action and neither do I.  He freezed up just like me.  After about 1.5 seconds of us not doing anything the dealer announces, ""player calls"".

I was floored because I was expecting the dealer to push me the chips.  What do you think?",1609583383

If yes, also on NL10 or just high stakes? 
I feel like this play is not profitable on NL10 bc nobody will fold a Q or gutshots or whatsoever and I block none of those hands

If this would have been be on NL10 I would have probably check folded given the fact that on NL10 people  call a 3 bet with a tighter range than they should = millions of hands they will call with, KQ, QJ, QT, AQ, AJ, AT, KJ, KT, JT, 22

What I've been thinking about doing is short stacking 25plo every time I get above $500 and play until I drop below. If I drop below I'll do a couple of thousands hands at 10plo and repeat until I get to $750 Where I will take a 10 buy in shot. 

Is this strat sounds, or is there a better way around it? It just seems a bit silly to play 10plo with 50+ buyins, but at the same time a bit risky playing 25plo with 20 buyins",1609579993

But if there's a 67% bet on both those streets for example is that still usually the best play? At deeper stacks you are supposed to call tighter and wider with lower medium stacks but I just cant wrap my head around what sizing bet a marginal made hand is not worth it. For example if utg +1 raises to say 3 bb and I call on button with jd 10s and rest is folded.

flop is Ah Js 2c I think ideally he has nut and range advantage on the board so he bets above 50% pot sizing so lets say 67% 

Villian bets 5bb 

I know I should call so if I did it would pot is now at 17.5

Got bored recently, found out I can play for real money again (Although not stars &gt;.&gt;), made an acc. with global poker, and played with the $20 that they give you free. I had a sick hot streak immediately, ITM 8 of 11 SNGs at the $3.3 level, moved up to $11, and did 6 out of 9. Then I proceeded to bust out of every single game until I busted. I would write it up to variance, except that I was consistently getting my money in good, and losing, time after time. Bit unhappy.

Made an acc. with Ignition, deposited $6, played $1.1 SNGs, busted 5 times in a row. Lost every single coinflip over those 5 games, and all but 1 60/40. Put in another $5, exact same thing for 5 more games. Again, lost every single coinflip, and all but 2 60/40s. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I feel like I'm playing a slot machine, not poker. And if I learned anything from 2020, it's that the conspiracy theorists may not be as crazy as they look. Did a little googling and the general opinion does seem a bit divided about the legitimacy of the less well regulated poker sites that operate in the US. I trust pokerstars more or less unconditionally, but what does r/poker think? Is it just me being salty about variance or bad play that I'm too scuffed to notice that led to such an impressive loss streak? When I played on stars I don't remember ever really busting \~20 times in a row (between both sites). I know the stakes are low, and losing $11 of bitcoin isn't going to have me late on rent, but even the small possibility that I'm the witless victim of a gambling racket makes me extremely anxious. I'm genuinely unsure, and I'd like to get someone else's opinion. Me actually being bad at the game is quite possible (haven't player for 9 years), but you don't have to be good at the game to understand that losing a dozen or so coinflips in a row is a bit of an eyebrow raiser.

Generally curious how many of you would make the same call that Bryn Kenney makes here against Nick Petrangelo. Seems so borderline to me. After the hand, JRB made a comment about how he would fold AKo here every single time. I don't really like JRB at all really, but I honestly feel like I would fold AKo here more than I would call. 

What do you all think? 

**Here is a review of the hand for those too lazy to click on the link. Unfortunately couldn't track down a video clip:**

&gt;KK vs. AK – Nick Petrangelo vs. Bryn Kenney: $519,800 Pot  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest pot of High Stakes Poker Season 8 Episode 3 was a classic cooler. Tom Dwan straddles to $1,600 and Nick Petrangelo finds Pocket Kings UTG and makes it $3,500 to go. Bryn Kenney picks up A♠K♦ on the button and 3-bets to $15,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;Big hands all around as Rick Salomon calls with A♦4♦ and so does Brandon Stevens with Pocket Jacks. Just like that there are $50,900 in the pot and when the action comes back to Dwan, he decides to make a play at the pot by 4-betting with 9♠8♠ to $71,000! **Pot Size: $120,300**  
&gt;  
&gt;Given that Nick Petrangelo is one of the shorter stacks with $207,000 or 128 big blinds behind, he only has one play here and that is to go all-in, which he does. Bryn has Nick covered and decides to make the call, everybody else folds. **Pot Size: $519,800**  
&gt;  
&gt;Great spot for Petrangelo, who is a 70% favourite, but they agree to Run It Twice and here are the two runouts:  
&gt;  
&gt;Nick wins the first one. However, in the second runout Bryn spikes an Ace on the turn and so they chop this massive pot.",1609552227

5971,Which site to start on?,poker,"So I used to play years ago before Full Tilt and the others basically were removed as options and looking to play again. Got a small amount of money I can throw in, but having trouble deciding which site to start with and a lot of the information I've found comparing them is older so not sure how currently relevant it all is which is why I'm asking here. 

Not a new player, though I am rusty and with my smaller bankroll I'll want to start with micro tables and especially tournaments to get back up to snuff before playing any bigger stakes. 

Would prefer an active site with lots of tournaments for multiple time slots, and preferably plenty of freeroll options which are actually accessible without 3rd party PWs. 

So far the options I've found are listed below:

Ignition/ACR/Intertops/BetOnline/Nitrogen

Any feedback on which of these would likely be best for me to get started on? Or any other big ones I'm missing? I live in Cali so PokerStars, 888Poker, and GGPoker aren't options.",1609546462

I really hate this flop. Villain's flatting range will have a lot of flushes so I decide to check and call any reasonable bet. If villain shoved all in here I think I gotta call right? Or is it a close decision given how deep villain is here.

The turn is a blank so I take the opportunity to make a stab at the pot. I get shoved on. What do I do here? On one hand villain is going to shoving all of their nutted hands here. All their flushes go nuts, KTs, AJs, AKs, all of that good stuff. Villain might have flatted 9s that turned a set (possible but unlikely). Villain is shoving KQ and maybe QJ here also. They are also likely shoving any Adx or Kdx they checked on the flop for some fold equity. Is villain shoving enough dominated hands to make a profitable call?",1609538950

UTG calls 1 BB, *fold*, *fold*, *fold*, **Hero raises to 5 BB**, *fold*, UTG calls 4 BB

I can already hear everyone saying ""fold pre"". This raise was a punt, I felt like getting aggressive and didn't really think past that. I had an ace blocker so thought ""eh this can't be THAT"" bad. Little did I know what would happen next.   


Flop (11 BB, 2 players):  
 Td8c5c  
**Hero bets 3 BB**, UTG raises to 7 BB, **Hero raises to 11 BB**, UTG calls 4 BB

This flop is more equalizing than most, so of course I decide to c-bet small to capitalize on my range disadvantage. I get a polarizing raise on a flop where villain has many sets and 2 pairs. I decide to call villain's bluff and raise him 4 more BB to top things off (calling the raise would be kinda justifiable given how many draws villain will have but at this point I'm just grasping at straws)  


Turn (33 BB, 2 players):  
 6c  
**Hero bets 15.8 BB**, UTG calls 15.8 BB

  
The turn card completes all of villain's draws and some straight draws that raise the flop so of course I go for a half pot bet to really put villain in a tough spot. Should he raise me all in? Should he call and slowplay? Really tough decisions villain has to be making here. Villain opts to go the slowplay route and call. 

River (64.6 BB, 2 players):  
 Qd  
**Hero bets 46 BB**, *fold*

  
The river has a card I should have. ME BET BIG. HIGH CARD GOOD. At this point I'm just praying shoveling more money in the pot will cause villain to fold. I have the 2 of clubs which blocks about ZERO flushes villain should have and I unblock all of villain's pairs and sets and straights (except AT I guess). I couldn't have picked a worse hand to bluff with if I tried.

Flop (37.8 BB, 4 players):  
 Js9d3d  
UTG checks, **Hero bets 18 BB**, *fold*, *fold*, UTG calls 18 BB

I half pot here targetting Jx and flush draws. Sure villain is going to have sets and 2 pairs some of the time here, but an overpair like KK is going to be ahead here the vast majority of the time. Should I have bet bigger here though? My reasoning was that 3/4 pot was too large and if I get raised I'll have to commit too much of my stack against a potentially nutted range.   


Turn (73.8 BB, 2 players):  
 2c  
UTG checks, **Hero bets 35.2 BB**, UTG calls 35.2 BB

Turn is a straight up brick. Villain's range is fairly capped because they didn't raise the flop, so I'm assuming villain now has more Jx and 9x in their range. Maybe TTs.  I decide to keep on barreling here. I debated going larger here but didn't want to fold out some of villain's weaker hands that might fold to a 3/4 pot bet. 

River (144.2 BB, 2 players):  
 7d  
UTG bets 36.4 BB and is all-in, **Hero calls 36.4 BB**

The river is a pretty bad card for me so I decide to check call to induce bluffs. All of villain's flush draws get there but the SPR here is so tiny. If I'm folding KKs here villain can just print money shoving with any 2 cards. I call and think ""whatever if he has the flush he has the flush"".

*fold*, **Hero raises to 3 BB**, CO calls 3 BB, *fold*, SB raises to 13 BB, *fold*, **Hero calls 10 BB**, CO calls 10 BB

Standard open, theoretically standard call but I'm starting to think folding hands like this would be higher EV than calling considering how nuttish 4-bet ranges tend to be. While in this specific scenario with CO unlikely to shove over me and the good pot odds, a call is probably better than folding but I played too recklessly postflop. 

I've been debating making an exploitative 4-bet defense strategy for a while and this hand really made that clear. When villain's 4-bet range is going to be so KK AA  saturated flops with multiple high cards are a disaster for me. KQs often flops meh, it's second best hand 100% of the time. I get beat out if we both make a flush (unlikely but possible), I get beat out if I make top pair. Really only 2 pair is a safe hand and I don't flop 2 pair often enough to make it worth flatting these kinds of 4-bets.   


Flop (40 BB, 3 players):  
 KdJh8s  
SB bets 38 BB, **Hero calls 38 BB**, *fold*

This flop is realistically one of the best flops I can get (which is why flatting KQ is so bad). I have some nut draw potential but most of my raw equity comes from my pair (which is outkicked fairly often). 

AK calling would be excusable because of the blockers, same thing with KJ suited but KQ suited calling is just a spewy play here when I'm going to be behind so much of the time. Every once in a while villain will show up with AJs or KTs but that doesn't happen often enough to offset my losses when they have a set or TPTK.   


Turn (116 BB, 2 players):  
 3c  
SB bets 35.4 BB and is all-in, **Hero calls 35.4 BB**

I called the flop hoping villain had AJs, I called the turn because it was a brick. All in all the flop call was a huge spew and the turn call a bit less so.

This is a standard open. SB minraises so I can't really be folding here, and 4-betting as a bluff kinda works but I don't think a middling ace is the right hand to do that with. Is my logic wrong? Should I be 4-betting instead?  


Flop (16 BB, 3 players):  
 AcTd3c  
SB checks, **Hero bets 5 BB**, MP calls 5 BB, *fold*

The flop is pretty dry. I'm in middle position so isn't it fine to bet some portion of the time without nutted hands/draw bluffs? Or am I still folding out all the hands worse than mine?  


Turn (26 BB, 2 players):

**Hero checks**, MP bets 24.8 BB, ***fold***

This is a horrible card for me so I decide to check. I face this huge pot sized bet from villain and just stew for a bit about what to do. Yes a lot of the time villain will be bluffing here with random air they didn't fold preflop, but they also have all the sets and all the flushes. I decide to fold but was that a mistake?   


MP wins 24.8 BB  
    
I don't know how to properly defend these spots when villain has the nut advantage and my hand is a bluff catcher. Do I randomize whether to call or fold? Do I call and reevaluate on the river? These kinds of spots really make me sweat because I don't know the correct defending frequencies",1609510681

BB checks, **Hero bets 2.2 BB**, BB calls 2.2 BB

This is a flop I like to range bet on. People open too loose so it's easy to get folds with small bets.   


Turn (10.8 BB, 2 players):  
 9c  
BB checks, **Hero bets 5.2 BB**, BB calls 5.2 BB

The turn gives me some equity so I decide to barrel here rather than check. In retrospect that was kinda stupid, the 9 pairs the board and gives villain trips (which villain has a lot of after calling the flop)  


River (21.2 BB, 2 players):  
 Ks  
BB bets 3 BB, **Hero raises to 16.2 BB**, BB raises to 92.4 BB and is all-in, ***fold***

Villain leads small which makes me believe they want to see a cheap showdown. I put villain on a small pocket pair. I like to punish small river bets by raising large regardless of my hand, but here I get shoved on and forced to fold. I don't like folding to such tiny river bets and allowing villain to get the pot for cheap, but a lot of the time villain leads small with their value hands for thin value. Should I really be raising here as a bluff or is villain's range too value heavy to be doing so?

It was a tough decision whether to 3-bet into 3 people or not here (because I'll often be called by aces that dominate me), but looking at some of the trash people limp call with I think 3-betting was slam dunk the right choice.

SB checks, **Hero bets 37 BB**, SB calls 28 BB and is all-in

The turn pairs the board which is far better for villain's range. I was really stuck here on whether to bluff barrel again or check behind and see if I realize my equity. People rarely call a large flop bet and fold to a large turn bet, so maybe checking was the right move?

I think that BB is using a typical lo-jack opening range, and I'm defending a little wider than a typical BB vs lo-jack defense range since we're super deep and I'm in position.

(95).  Flop Jh5s4h, he bets 65, I raise to 175, he calls.

(445). Turn is the 8h.  All the sudden, all my bluffs get here.  Probably the weakest hand I ever have here is 45s.

When this happens, do we range bet small like 150, range bet big like 300, or do we put in some checks with our weaker holdings (sets / 2 pair), and make it larger with the rest?",1609424334

6093,"Hand Review 2.5/5, 6 Handed Online",poker,"Hey all, wondering if I could've done something differently here against this specific player.

Villain in this scenario is an absolute fish, he bought in for $150 into the $2.5/$5 game, saw him call down with bottom pair on a super wet board. 

Anyways, action folds to him and he limps on the button. I have Kh 10h in the small blind and raise to $22.5. BB folds, button calls (No surprise).

Flop comes Jh 4d Ah. I check and he bets about 3/4 pot. At this point I've basically put him on an ace since he plays very straightforwardly. I just call, which is the decision I'm questioning the most in hindsight. At the time, I felt like had I check raised him, he would never find the fold button with top pair. Do I really want to get it all in with him for a flip?

Anyways the turn comes the 3s. He bets like 3/4 pot again which is basically his entire stack and I call again. Unfortunately the river comes the 3d and I don't improve. He shows Ad 2c. 

Ultimately I'm less concerned with the loss but more concerned with my decision making. Is it worth just jamming on the flop? I feel like I have no fold equity against fish (especially fish that never fold top pair) so I'm still unsure as to what the best play here was.

Also as icing on the cake he immediately leaves the room after winning this hand.",1609398448

I play poker for fun, gambling and the prospect of small wins. My biggest buy-in is $5, tourney or cash games. I just can't justify regularly risking more than that, I have plenty of bills and I'd rather keep some money in my fun budget for movies, hobbies, etc. 

I've been to MGM Natl Harbor twice, and the smallest buy-in for cash games is $100. Both times I said ""hey, it's a rare chance I get to come here, if I lose like $50 I'll pack it up, if I ship it with kings and run into aces, oh well"". But I want to play more often, which means I'm risking that stack regularly, and moreover I love tourneys/sitngos, but it's either win or lose your whole $100. 

Any regulars at Natl Harbor? Can you tell me if the games are soft, like I have a reasonable chance to at least break even? How do you guys justify the high buy-in of live poker, whether at Natl Harbor or elsewhere? Out of curiosity do other casinos nationwide offer like, $20 tourneys?",1609342194

The rules are simple : when you post the entry fee, half of it goes to the prize pool, and the other half becomes the chips you play with in the tourney. The prize pool can be distributed as in classical tournament, with payouts to the top 15% of players. Meanwhile, players can withdraw from the tournament any time they are not playing a hand, and they can take home the cash in their chip stack, but forfeit the prize money.

6157,Hand History Deep 1/1 Game,poker,"Played in a home game last night. First time there. Average was around 500bb. Had 2 note worthy hands. Would like everyone's thoughts on how to extract max value from these hands.

H1 (9handed)

Red 55 in Big blind. LJ opens to 10. Sb calls I call. (32) 

I have $800 behind, LJ covers all of us. SB has about $120 left.   


Flop K Jc 5c. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sb check I check, LJ 28. SB jams 120 behind. (Pot 180) What does Hero do here?

&amp;#x200B;

I think that LJ's range includes AA, KJ+, Q10s and some A high flush draws. Based on how he's played so far, I dont think he would bet gutters. 

I'm not too worried about SB's jam because he would have raised KK or JJ preflop given his stack size, ofc he could be holding KJ but it's mostly a strong draw.

Here's what I think about flatting vs raising.

IMO flatting here in between both players could seem strong. From LJ's POV, what does my flatting range look like here? Considering that he's willing to sit 1000 big blinds deep in a 1/1 game, and that he has played 5/5 in the past, I would consider him to be a thinking player. I think hands that have me beat would consider calling behind if I call here. 

Raising here seems like the most attractive option here to thin out the field. We make LJ fold most of his strong equity hands that do not have us beat (unless they're looking to gamble after we've shown so much strength). But at the same time we are unable to extract value from worst hands like AA/KJ/AK. 

Q1. What appropriate sizing should we be raising to (if we elect to raise) OTF?

Q2. What are the downsides to flatting SB's jam OTF in hopes of extracting max value from LJ?

&amp;#x200B;

H2

7 handed

I have red 66 OTB. I'm effective at 600. HJ covers me

HJ opens to 12 over 2 dollar straddle. I flat and SB flats (39)

&amp;#x200B;

Flop 633r sb checks HJ fires 23. I flat and sb folds (85)

&amp;#x200B;

We have the board on lockdown here and I think there's very little reason to be raising. Raising here folds out a large portion of his air type hands and it's very unlikely that he has anything decent that can call a raise. HJ seems to be competent player from the table talk, and I am inclined to believe that he is raising pre as a steal in late position. 

Turn 9d (6 3 3 9dd), bringing in a diamond draw

HJ bets $63. Hero flats (??) (Pot is now 210)

Betting on the 9 turn definitely narrows his range. 77/88 and gutters are likely to just check. Maybe TT+ can consider checking this turn as my high card floats OTF do not improve. He could perhaps check to induce a bluff from my high card hands. Personally I think that he would be inclined to bet TT+ for value. Not sure if straight draws continue betting here but it's very likely that he would check his gutters here. Of course he could be value betting his 3s as well. 53/43?

River comes Td bringing in the backdoor flush draw.

HJ checks and bet $260

My mind was preoccupied with trying to put his overpairs in a tough spot and therefore elected to overbet the pot.

HJ quickly folds

Q2. Would a smaller sizing be more appropriate on the river vs V's whole range?

6161,Were You Interested in other competitive games or sports besides getting into Poker?,poker,"I ask because I started getting interested in poker when I was like 10 and didn't get into other forms of competition until my late 20s when I was already a jaded cash game pro when I stumbled upon a competitive Tetris YouTube video and that somehow lead me to a competitive Pokemon video (I'll say this, it's surprisingly similar to Poker). 

I would lie if I didn't say that I didn't trigger some regrets. Everybody involved in those scenes looks so happy in comparison to my peers who aren't miserable, precisely, but jaded, that spark for the game is gone and now it's a job. I played both of those games obsessively as a kid, probably could've been a pro-Pokemon player, wouldn't that be a fun job title? Imagine telling your 9-year-old self that you play Pokemon for a living. That would be sick. 

Anyway, just hoping some of you jumped ship from other competitive scenes to Poker and validate my life decisions...",1609323419

6163,Did I play these hands correctly?,poker,"I was playing 1/3NL at Caesars. Hand #1- The game just started and the first hand I get dealt is JdJc in the hijack. We all have $300 starting.

Lojack limps, I make it $15, 3 players call. 

The flop comes Kd 5d 3h. BB donk leads $30. I call, other 2 fold. I'm a little bit confused as to why he's leading out on this board that should always favor me .. but I was going to C-bet $30 anyways so whatever.

Turn comes 3d. Board: Kd 5d 3h 3d. BB continues for $40. I call. River brings the 9d giving me the 3rd best flush. Without much thought at all he grabs a stack and bets out $100. I snap call and he doesn't want to show. I show the pocket jacks and win with J high flush. How would you say I played this? Should I have check-raised the turn?


Hand #2. A couple hands later I get involved with the same player from above. 
I have QcQs on the button with a $600 stack. This same player opens to $15 with about $450 behind. Lojack calls, CO calls, I decide to 3b it to $95 with $45 dead money out there, to isolate the UTG. 

UTG calls for $80 more, other players fold. At this point I'm positive he doesn't have a better hand than me, obviously. 

Flop comes 4d 4h 3h. He just instantly jams it in for around $350. I call pretty quickly assuming he probably has JJ, 10s, AK. 

Turn is 7s, river is Jc which I was a little bit concerned about... but, once again he's hesitant to show his hand. I just turn over my queens and the lady next to this player says ""he has AK, I can see his cards"". He angrily throws his hand away. 

Do you think my sizing preflop is ok? Anything I should do differently? I'm not sure what this guy was doing on either hand. With the JJ hand I'm really not sure why he's leading out on a board texture that should always favor me as the pre-flop aggressor. Really don't know why he decided to bluff when the 4th diamond hit on the river. Logically thinking, I should have the Ad/Qd a lot more than him when he flats from the BB..? As with the AK vs QQ hand, I think he should just be shipping it before the flop if his plan is to jam the flop regardless. What are your thoughts?",1609319333

6178,[5z] 2 super weird delayed check-raises,poker,"Both hands from Ignition 5NL Zone where I turned/rivered some pretty good hands but my opponents put me to some weird tests.

**Hand 1: Straight vs. 4x pot river check-raise (\~100bb deep)**

Preflop: SB opens $0.15, I defend BB with 76o no heart (maybe too loose).

Flop ($0.29): KhTh9c. Check, check.

Turn ($0.29): As. Check, I bet $0.15, SB calls.

Maybe I can fold out some higher garbage. Make it look credible. Doesn't make sense to bet large very often.

River ($0.57): 8h. Check, I bet $0.43, SB insta-jams for $4.44 effective.

Idk what I'm doing here, just want to get paid.

Insta-jam is pretty funny. QJ, J7, and 76 make very little sense. Anything worse for value extremely unlikely given the insta-jam. I can have some flushes as well and I am usually not going that much thinner for value (at worst A8), so feels fine to fold here, though I'm curious as to what SB had. Probably just a 9x/Ax flush that really wanted to get paid by a hand like mine though. Tbh kind of hoping for one of them rare pair+blocker bluffs (e.g. JhJx/AhX) that just panic-jammed when I bet the river.

**Hand 2: Turned set vs. delayed check-raise, 3b pot (\~150bb deep)**

Preflop: I open BTN ($7.53) to $0.15 with 44 (no heart), SB 3b to $0.60, I call.

Flop (\~$1.20): KhJc9h. Check, check.

Turn (\~$1.20): 4h. SB check, I bet $0.60, SB insta-raises to $1.80, I call.

Don't think it makes too much sense to bet large or 3b against the check-raise as both of us are pretty capped (x/r looks super suspicious but I figured just let SB do his thing. Only problem is a ton of terrible cards can come on the river.)

River (\~$4.80): 6s. SB insta-jams $5.13.

Nothing better than my hand makes much sense for value (maybe a few flushes, but still seems unlikely to check twice on this board given how often people cbet in these pots). River was as good as it gets and I ended up calling off because it seemed way too suspicious and unlike in H1 I'm pretty much at the top of my range except for specifically AJhh/JThh.",1609294704

For instance, I go into Equilab, and I put a flop of 7dTh9h. Now, I would think that this board hits the PFC's range (say a BTN or BB calling range) much better than a PFR's range (say LJ or HJ opening range). For instance, this opening range:

Hero 110BBs (effective)
Villain 225BBs

Hero in the SB dealt AQs.

Villain in the CO raises to 3BB, button folds, hero 3 bets to 13BB, BB folds, villain calls. Pot is 27BBs.

I've got the villain tagged as a tight and fairly conservative player, I've been betting and 3-betting into them quite a lot, because I've been getting the hands to do so, though I am aware they must think I'm a little LAG. I wouldn't be surprised if they were getting a little tilted. They do over fold, something I've been trying to exploit.

Had they 4-bet pre-flop I was probably going to fold, given how tight they are, I was pretty sure they would only 4-bet with AA, KK, QQ, AK. I was fairly pleased with their call, figuring I'm up against QQ, JJ, AKo at worst, TT, 99, AQs, AJs, KQs at best.

Flop comes A43 2-tone. I did something a little strange here though, and checked the flop. I guess as I figured I was ahead, I wanted to try and induce a bluff. Villain bets 17BB, I call. Tbh that they bet 2/3 pot did have me a little worried, but a call seems fair? Pot is 61BBs

Turn gives a 4, giving a 3-tone board. I check, villain bets 38BBs. This has me worried and I go in the tank, as if I call here I'm pot committed. I'm sure I can count out them having AA, given there was no 4-bet pre-flop. Given how tight they are I put them on AK, but given there was no 4-bet pre convince myself they may be slightly tilted, or may be semi-bluffing (though I've not seen them bluff much). I call.

River is a blank, I check, they go all-in, and at this point I know they have AK. They have to have it. I have about 44BBs behind and reluctantly call - I have to call here right?

Villain wins with AKo. Literally this is the only hand that they can have, AA or AKs 4-bets pre-flop most of the time, there's only 6 combos of AKo out there. I don't see them having 3 of a kind, a set or quads because of the pre-flop play.

It is what it is, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, I just wondered if there were any glaring errors in the way I played the pot, and could I have got away from it on the turn or the river?",1609280311
6199,"Crushing NL5, get crushed at NL10",poker,"I started playing micros back in April and worked my way up to becoming a solid winner at NL5 with a winrate over 10bb/100. I was actually so confident and ambitious that I received some private coaching, thinking I would probably crush NL10 too and eventually work my up to NL25 by 2021. What actually ended up happening was I played NL10 for maybe a month and got destroyed. Lost about 14 BI in just 10k hands and quit. I didn't play poker at all for 4 months.

I recently started playing again and the exact same thing happened - I beat NL5 comfortably but when I took a shot at NL10 I lost again, capped off by my worst session ever. I frankly don't have any motivation to keep playing NL5 - I know I can beat it but the miniscule winnings aren't worth it for me anymore. This puts me in a position where I basically need to learn to beat NL10, otherwise I have no reason to play.

I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement, whether that's advice or similar stories from people who have recently made the jump from NL2/NL5 to NL10 and up. Are there any resources I should look into? I've been thinking about Red Chip Poker's online program and the price seems pretty good for what you get.

6216,Live Poker Questions and etiquette,poker,"I'm still fairly new to playing poker, especially live but I got a chance to put in a session last weekend of $1/2 and I've got a few observations and questions that I'd like to run by you. 

*Slow play or just a really bad Tell?*  
So, my third hand in, I get dealt A9cc in the BB. I'll save you the gory details but Limped Pot, Bet on the Flop from SB, I'm the only one to call with 2 clubs. c/c on the Turn and a 8c hits the River.   
Now, the SB bets for $100 (Crazy overbet) and I go into the Tank, because I want to make extra-special sure that I have the nuts. There's no straight flush, no paired board. I'm going over and over for at least 60 seconds which feels like an eternity.   
I do the super lame, 'I guess I'm all-in,' for $225, push my chips over the line and the SB snaps call. I show, he mucks and says more to himself I think, that I slow played my hand.   
I should mention that there were several times where I faced a raise with the nutter-butters and completely tanked for a minute making sure that I indeed had the nuts. I would always then raise and I swear, I almost always got called. I never tanked though when action folded to me when I had the Nutter Butters.   
So, I get that it's probably a bad tell that I should work on, but was I slow-playing or God forbid, slow rolling anyone?

*Rude opening bet?*  
I took Jonathan Little's course for a few months and bought a series on Upswing early this year and both talked about opening to 3x the BB, so $6-8 at the $1/2 game. At the first few games I went to, I was shocked(!) when someone had the audacity to regularly bet +$10. What a rude-head!  
Then, I watched a few YT videos where they said that at $1/2, everyone at the table will call for anything less than $10.   
Last weekend, I tried the $10 open and was AMAZED at how many times I won pre-flop. Amazed. I should mention that I would add an increment for every limper, so it got up there sometimes. So, then I bet $8 and I would always get called by at least 5 callers. I would -normally- call $6 and up, especially if I had a middle pocket pair.   
But, was that me being a rude-head for opening so big? I'd hate to be told, even in jest, to go jump on a $2/5 table or something. Because I kinda get it, I think maybe they all wanted to see cheap flops and don't want some rude-head spoiling their time. 

*Color Up?*  
What's the ruling on coloring up? I was doing well enough where I had several stacks of reds and people wanted to sell me their greens. Is there a particular balance to strike with chips?

*One Hand in particular*  
One of the last hands of the night was TT from the SB. EVERYONE limped and I was like, 'damn, do I really want to be like, $22 to clear out all of this nonsense? And then get 1-2 callers that hits their overpair?""  
So I limp, BB limps behind and BB wins a big pot because they boated their J3o when the flop was J33. Ironically, I'm almost positive I lost at least $22 on that hand.    
What's the optimal move in something like this?

Thanks for your help!",1609262863

Villain isn't going to have many tripshere, MAYBE they have 56 suited but the main hand I have to worry about is TT. I'm almost never going to have the nuts here but I have plenty of high equity overpairs that dont mind building a pot so I think betting here is good.

I size up here on the turn but was my bet too large? I get value from villain's flush draws and Tx and JJ and the double flush board makes a larger bet more justifiable I thought.

**Hero checks**, BTN bets 35.2 BB, **Hero calls 35.2 BB**

This is probably the worst river card for me. I'm not quite sure if I should check call or check fold here, but I know betting is out of the question so I decide to check first and decide later. Villain bets a small bet of around half pot which is really painful. Double paired boards are notoriously underbluffed but villain is going to have a lot of missed flush draws and the bet sizing is very tiny. How often does villain have to be bluffing here to make a call profitable?

Standard open, standard 4-bet. Theoretically I should be flatting with jacks when I get 3-bet in later positions,  but for some reasons the charts say I should be mainly 4-betting in early position. Why is that? I also like this 4-bet because Villain is kinda short stacked and I can put them in dicey situations on the flop and turn by betting large. I also wouldn't mind getting it in pre here or folding out AK, AQs type hands preflop.

The flop is probably as good as it gets for me without having a spade in hand. I'm a bit bummed out because it's montone though so villain will have some flopped flushes, especially because I don't have a spade in hand. SPR here is close to 1 so we are getting it in on the flop or turn. I know theory says to check here, but I just open shoved because we're getting it in anyway and I don't want a spade to come on the turn and force me to fold my decently strong hand, Was this a mistake? Should I have just check called instead? Let's say the flop went check check and the turn is a blank. It would be safe to shove all in then right?

Flop (6.4 BB, 2 players):  
 KsTh4c  
**Hero checks**, BTN bets 6.2 BB, ***fold***

This board is a homerun for villain's range so I opt to check. My plan here is to call any reasonable bet and reevaluate on the turn if villain is going to keep on barreling. Then villain hits me with a full pot bet which really stops me in my tracks. What exactly is villain potting with here? Sets, obviously. Weaker top pairs. Some Tx that wants to take down the pot quick. I thought long and hard about what to do. Obviously the theoretically correct approach would be to call and reevaluate on the turn if Villain wants to keep on barreling, but how much of villain's range is checking on the turn??All the Tx sure but everything else will just keep on pumping money in the pot. While it's true villain could have a hand like JT or QT, I didn't feel like they'd be potting the flop with enough of these weaker hands to make continuing worthwhile. Probably like 70% of the time after a flop pot bet villain continues barreling half pot+. If I'm just going to end up folding on the turn shouldn't I just save the chips and fold here? Of course you could also argue that if I'm folding AT what exactly am I continuing with. BB won't have many strong hands to defend with on a board like this so I should be calling with this hand to make sure I'm not just being bluffed. I agree with that logic but I just can't see enough bluffs here. Was I wrong?

Only time I've seen the hand he shoved with is when I called with aces from bb and he  jammed j10s from open position.

*fold*, *fold*, **Hero raises to 3 BB**, SB raises to 11 BB, *fold*, **Hero raises to 23 BB**, SB calls 12 BB

Normally I would just fold here but I decided to go for the 4-bet semibluff. Obviously I can't 4-bet AQo at any real frequency or else I'm 4-betting far too often, but it doesn't hurt to do so every once in a while I felt.   


Flop (47 BB, 2 players):  
 Td8s7c  
SB checks, **Hero checks**

I debated for a little whether to bet or check but I felt the flop was a little too dynamic to be betting here often since villain has the nut advantage. Was I wrong?   


Turn (47 BB, 2 players):  
 Jc  
SB checks, **Hero bets 22.4 BB**, *fold*  


This bet here I feel was a huge mistake. I went for a semi-bluff half pot bet, but I don't think AQo makes a very good bluff hand. I block some overpairs but I also block overcards. Overpairs  would usually be betting the turn and villain here has all the sets and straights. I'm in position so it isn't as bad a bet, but I still feel like this bet was a mistake, or at least the sizing. 

**Hero wins 44.8 BB**

I know in this particular spot the check was a sign of weakness, but Villain could easily wake up here with a monster raise. When should I be check betting in pots like this?",1609218309

Flop: AhQc3h (2 hearts).

Action checks to hero who puts in a $55 bet. Cut-off folds, Button calls, Lo-Jack folds. (Heads up w/ Button).

The dealer puts out the turn before the Lo-Jack folds. The card exposed is the 6c. Dealer takes the turn card back, and re-shuffles the deck.

Turn: 7h

Hero checks. Button bets $100 into \~$200 pot, effectively committing his stack with $70 behind. 

Is this a call on the turn? 

My read on the guy is that he can be sticky to a flop bet with a draw or middle pair. He can also have top pair worse kicker that improves with random turn cards. But hes never completely full of shit.

After the dealer messed up, my thought process kind of sped up, and idk how the exposed card should factor into my decision making (if at all) but I was just wondering if anyone had thoughts on facing this turn bet sizing with top two pair on this board.

Pre Flop: Villain seemed to be a TAG preflop so I didn't want to risk being 4 bet by J+ and AK.

Flop: Villain seemed to make lots of continuation bets, so I elect to just call the bet on the flop to keep him in the hand, and the flop was dry so I didn't need to raise to protect against draws.

Turn: When Villain bets again, I put him on a pretty small range of 10+, because I haven't seen him do any double barrel bluffs and he is out of position. At this point, I am trapping and planning to shove on the river.

River: Villain bets, and I jam. Seemed pretty standard for a full house. I am still wondering how I ended up getting called. In earlier hands, I've been caught doing some double and triple barrel bluffs, and check-raising continuation bets as bluffs from out of position. I wonder if because of this, if I was labeled as a maniac by Villain and he may have overplayed an overpair?

I've been playing poker in Red Dead Online (a cowbow video-game) the stakes are just low sums of in-game currency so there isn't a great deal of gamesmanship, most other players tend to bet close to the max if they have anything. The blinds are 10c/20c with a 5 dollar max. With that being the case, it got me wondering: is it ever worth chasing a Straight or a Flush? 

All things being equal, if you played it out 10,000 times, with max bets is it ever worth chasing a final card if you know that would be the best hand? How many players would you need in a game for that to be worth it?

6327,Grinders Manual going over my head,poker,"Been reading it and having to go back quite often since I'm just not getting it.

How do you calculate RFE, Equity, Pot Odds, etc on the fly? How do you know that something is a +EV move when it could very easily lose you an entire buy in? What even makes a +EV move +EV? Like, sure, opening with KTo from the SB can be considered +EV, but if you only land the flop a fraction of the time then you're just throwing away money and likely not making up for the losses with the very few times you'll get called enough to make any money. 

Open - miss flop - fold. lose money.

Open - hit flop - bet - everyone folds. make up for one missed flop.

Open - hit flop - bet - someone calls - bet again - they fold. Make up for maybe two missed flops.

&amp;#x200B;

You'd need to hit the flop a large percentage of the time to make up for the losses you get for betting and missing the flop, losing you money.

&amp;#x200B;

What about when you miss the flop, C-Bet, get called down and lose a whole bunch of money? 

&amp;#x200B;

Etc, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand how players are doing all this math within 20 seconds in order to make a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

And you will miss the flop a huuuuuge percentage of the time, no matter what your hand is. So by continuing to bet on missed flops you're just throwing away money for no reason. This doesn't make any sense to me, unless you \_know for a fact\_ they will fold. Which you can't, because you can't see their cards. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost more money by trying to follow all this theoretical nonsense and determine what's a ""good"" move or not based on math, rather than what I know about how the player plays. It makes more sense to me to just observe how they play and what their ranges are, then decide what to do based on your hand and the flop, instead of the theoretical idea that one bet sizing is more optimal than the other, and that even though you've flopped dead completely you should bet because it will pay off a tiny amount after a million hands. Why not just fold that so you don't lose money now, and then bet it in the situation you think it will make you money in?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems \_a lot\_ of learning resources are just based on cookie cutter theory rather than situational awareness. I'm a losing player, so I'm not an authority here, but I'm \_much\_ more of a losing player when I try to put these things into practice. I'll bust my entire bankroll in a few hours by trying to use these ideas I'm learning, as opposed to just playing based on the situation at hand and losing my bankroll in a week. Either way it's losing, but I feel like saying ""this will pay off in 6 months"" is just a sure-fire way to go bust faster.",1609175659
6328,Responses to Rude Attempts to Chop,poker,"Made it pretty deep in the last few $1k tournaments I've played. I don't find it fun to chop and rather play it all out, short stack, big stack or even, i'd rather play it out. 
The last couple got kind of heated, especially when we got heads up. What are good responses to get these pia's to shut up?

The first guy was calling me an a**hole, saying to never speak to him again any other time I see him in the poker room. He ended up winning. The second one a week later, guy complaining to chop every 15-20 minutes starting from 6 players left. It's finally us two heads up and he keeps asking, starts calling me a stubborn pos, a greedy a**hole, what's wrong with me, he'll do even chop even he has me by 3:2 chips. I go on to win. Funny thing, he made a good bit more because I was against any kind of chop (icm, chip count, etc.) at 6 vs what he made in 2nd, yet still so mad.

6350,Just getting back into the game. Need help.,poker,"I stopped playing seriously in 2009, the economy tanked in my area and I had to move away to get work. I used my 20k poker bankroll to finance the move and living expences while waiting for work. I moved back home 3 years ago, now I have a wife and 1.3 children. For some reason the games around here have picked back up, 1-2nl 3/week, 5-5nl 5/month, 5-10 1/month, theres also a crazy dealers choice home game, I'm avoiding because I dont have a big enough bankroll yet. 

The games are super soft, I played 1-2nl earlier tonight and made $300 in 3 hours without getting slapped with the deck. To give you an idea how soft, the player on my left doubled me up she had third pair and called me down the whole hand. Later she tried to bluff me off a $90 pot that was checked the whole way down with a $15 bet on the river, I called with 9s and won. 

I've read lots of books, studied flopzilla ranges against hands till my eyes bled. I have a good poker math understanding. My gameplan is pretty simple, I play tight aggressive until I win a couple hands at showdown, then I loosen up and limp a little more until I win a couple at showdown, rinse and repeat basically. I've never had problems getting paid off with it. Limping minimizes the losses if I miss the flop. Mind you the game I play in is very weak loose, people routinely call 5xbb with j6 off, got beat by it twice tonight lol. 

Here's what I need help with. 

What stats do I keep? I never kept stats before, I didnt even keep track of wins and loses, my bankroll just kept growing without any infusions from real life money and it's the only gambling I did (I gamble on the golf course now). 

What should I be studying? Reviewing hands isn't something I love to do, but I'm game to get better. Any go to software recommendations are more than welcome. 

What books should I be reading? YouTube channels? Blogs?

6395,Down 50Bi,poker,"Since I started to play NL10 I lost 50BI
When I started I basically never played cash before
That I lost in the beginning wasnt surprising 

Then I started playing seriously which means folding even strong hands when I knew I was beaten
-&gt; got 2.5 bb /100 hands over 25k hands, still there was tilt included

I thought „ok now i am a winning player“
Then I got some bad beats and was loosing some buyins which lead to me tilting and punting off stacks (I started to call with marginal hands in marginal spots because I thought the reason I am loosing was me getting exploited)


At the beginning of december I set myself the goal to play 1k hands a day minimum and averaging 5bb/100 over 30k hands

On the 10. I was half way through, winning 6bb/100, I know I was not only lucky as you might think now, I made good laydowns, some good heros and played solid poker

I know I am not the worst if I stick to a tight strategy but I am very very bad when it comes to tilting, I also tend to bluff very often bc I think „I have to try it bc otherwise I cant win the hand, despite me knowing the bluff probably wont get through bc my opponent has a very strong range“

I played ~100k hands so far and I know that I improved a lot since the beginning and I guess its also normal to loose especially if you are still learning 

I am also not interested in moving down bc I am simply not interested in playing NL5 or NL2 (because of the money and bc strategy is even worse, than it is on NL10) I want to move up the stakes and I am willing to learn as well

Did anyone got a similar problem when you started? What helped you and which advice can you give me?

In a 6max double or nothing sit and go, it's on the bubble. Everyone has equal stack sizes and the blinds are very high.

I give the BB a calling range of 9.3%. This is 66+, AT+, A9s.

I give the SB a calling range of 7.4%. This is 88+, AJ+, ATs.

In my experience, you're getting called by **at least** this range of hands. Usually you're getting called a fair bit looser than this.

Even with this tight range of hands they are calling, it recommends just to push JJ+ and AQ+.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand why you shove so few hands? If you shoved that tight, you would get blinded out very quickly and generally get run over. I see players, including winning regs, shoving wider than this from these positions. Can anyone explain why SitNGo Wizard recommends such a narrow shoving range?",1609084122

6400,Adding 3bet bluffing ranges in analysis,poker,"Yooo. I'm doing some work on Flopzilla and have always had this issue that I'm not sure what ranges to put in for V's 3bet bluffs.

6401,Final table all-in : did I screw up?,poker,"Hi!

I had quite a nice run in my local live tournament tonight. About 100 entries, we are only 4 players left. I was super short but doubled up unexpectedly, still quite short with about 16BB.

Stack sizes are about : 70BB for UTG and 40BB for both the Button and SB.

Another thing : from there, prizes are increasing kinda exponentially :
4th : 300$
3th : 700$
2th : 1200$
1th : 2400$

So, UTG opened 2.5BB. He's a player that didn't do anything crazy from what I saw, but I thought that he could try to abuse and steal the blinds a fair share of the time. 

Other players fold, and I pick up A5o on the BB. I decided to go all-in. I wouldn't do that if I was closer to the other stacks but here I was in a very awkward situation, with a hand pretty bad to call and on the verge to go all-in with. I believe I would do it without thinking too much with A8+, so it could be close to what's acceptable. 

Anyway, would you rather fold here and wait for a better spot? Or even call? 

For the result, my opponent finally called with 55 after tanking a lot (almost folded). His pocket holded, and I thought my play was awful at the time. Right now I'm not so sure though.

I convince myself ""they're just being really aggressive with a weak overpair"" or ""they're playing TPTK like the nuts"" but I know for a FACT they have the goods but I'm just too stubborn to lay down my super strong hand. After making a few disciplined laydowns in a row I just get angry and shove it in even when I'm certain I'm behind and then I tilt away a huge stack I spent the whole session building up. How do you keep  calm and keep from tilting away your stack and make these disciplined folds day in and day out?",1609076806

6407,[Preflop fundamentals] Squeezing medium offsuit broadways,poker,"Recently discovered that I'm pretty clueless with what to do with certain medium-strength offsuit hands that don't play that well deep and/or multiway. I usually (but not always) try to squeeze to get the pot heads up with shallower stack depth. Recently, I've been getting a variety of situations from ""one caller, flop top pair good kicker"" to ""two fish cold call the 3b and we go 5 ways to a flop of 8h6h5d"" so would kind of like some opinions on if some of these plays are just lighting my money on fire.

What do you think of the play in these examples? (Assuming anonymous small stakes game where the average player is a somewhat loose caller and mainly 4bets with AK/QQ+):

* HJ opens 3bb, CO flats, hero BU 3bets to 12bb with KQo.
* CO opens 3bb, SB flats, hero BB 3bets to 15bb with AJo.
* HJ opens 3bb, BU flats, hero BB 3bets to 15bb with AQo.

\#1 is generally at least a call if against HJ only, I tend to 3b as I don't want the blinds coming along. With CO calling, maybe this is too loose, but calling to go to a 3-4 way flop doesn't seem +EV. Maybe I should just fold?

\#2 Usually a call or 3bet in position, and a defend from the BB vs. one open. Better situation than #1, but not ideal to have this go 3 ways. Maybe just take our odds and call?

\#3 Similar to #2 (slightly stronger hand vs. slightly stronger ranges), usually see this as call/3bet heads up in position, defend from the BB.

I assume squeezing vs. any earlier positions in each case is too loose, while with the suited versions of these hands seems ok.",1609072132

6414,Winning Poker Network Cheating?,poker,"I was wondering if there is anyone who plays on the Winning Poker Network with America's Cardroom or Black Chip Poker? Tonight while playing a session, I noticed a wild player who I was happy to see everytime he would get dealt into my table. He would play almost every hand, play like a complete idiot and yet was a huge winner. I think that cheating is the only possible reason how someone can play so bad and yet win so much. I play with a HUD and there are a couple stats that jumped out at me right away that I don't believe are possible without cheating. 

His W$SD was 90. For those of you that don't know that means won money at show down. A good W$SD is anything over 50 and I have seen some good players have a percentage as high as 60. I have never seen 90, and I have never seen 90 from someone who plays like a complete idiot and plays ever hand. 

I haven't played on the network that long but my sample size is 30,000 hands so far. The amount of hands with this guy with a W$SD stat of 90 is over 1200 hands. 1200 isn't a lot but I went through hands that I folded and didn't see play out and they are just like ""potripper"" from Ultimatebet and that superuser scandal.

7 years later I still play but constantly debate whether I should even be playing. Especially online. I work 50 hours a week in a job I like with upward potential, have a girlfriend, and don’t have the time to spend full days studying/grinding. 

I try to play for ‘fun’ but that usually either means busting the 500 bucks or whatever I deposit online pretty quick, or running hot for a while and then all of a sudden getting really into poker again and eventually losing it back. Lol. During the good runs, I neglect other hobbies/competitive interests and then when the run good ends I’m obviously pissed I lost the money back but also pissed I wasted xxxx hours of my life that could’ve been spent on other things. 

Just seems kind of pointless to play for me in the current environment. This cycle has gone on for me for like 3 years lol. Maybe I have a mild gambling problem even though the money I’m losing has zero effect on my life, idk.

6419,Should these be instant shoves against a player who tends to over play his hands?,poker,"A couple hands from tonight, player who hmmmm. I tend to get into trouble with because I know he over bets and calls too light, so you want to be the one taking his money early. Well at this point he's gotten lucky calling another play super light(he called all in on the flop on a pair board, with a 6 high flush draw, and hit the river against the guys trips). It's an online home game.

So he's up pretty big on the night. Villian at 70$ for the first hand 4 handed, hero at 32$, blinds .01/.20.

Hero with Khjs on the bottom. UTG/CO folds. Hero make eit 2.5 to .50, BB calls. 

Pot 1.10.  flop 86T all hearts hero with a 2nd nut draw and backdoor straight, 2 overs BB checks. Hero bets half pot.BB calls.

Pot 3.30 turn 3h. BB decided to lead out for full pot 3.30. hero calls, thats a concerning bet. But let's see the river.

Pot 9.90 river 2h. BB bets pot again?

Hero thinks it over...he shouldn't bet like this with the queen of hearts.....but ok I say he's likely too. In theory maybe he's trying to get the king to fold but no.... overplaying again probably. 50/50 ace or queen so my odds to call are great. I call he shows down queen if hearts... 


So this is the kind of hand I mean when I can sometimes get in trouble.  Is this a shove? He shouldn't play like this but he calls a shove there...

Next hand a couple orbits 3 handed, hero at 47.00, hero SB villian button calls. Hero completes with k4ss. BB checks. 

Pot .60 flop khkd8s.

Nailed the flop pretty hard...nothing in the pot. hero donks a min bet of .20, villain calls.

Pot 1.00 turn 4h. We boat up.  I think check is good here. Let's try and see if he bets or somehow improves. Villian checks back.

River 5s....ok bummer not an action card. Hero bets 2/3, villian raises to 1.80. interesting, hero 3bets to 3.60. I expect a fold here, but he can still call pretty wide.

Villian jams covering hero. About 40 to call. Not a lot of hands that should play like this. I don't have the worst boat, 3rd nuts, but is a naked king doing this? What about pocket fives or 8s. I have underrepped my hand a little, but hmmmm.

I time bank 90 or so seconds and call, villian shows k9, I hand that doesn't even make sense... Is this an easier call? I probably fold ak here.",1609049421

6421,Hand analysis 3/5 NL,poker,"Playing 3/5, and the following ensued.

I'm on the button, six-handed. JJ. 1st three players fold, then I raise to $15.  SB folds, BB calls.

Flop comes out 4TT.  I bet $25 into a $37 pot. BB calls.

Turn is a K. I check, BB checks. 

River is a 10. 

BB bets $200 into an $87 pot, which looks like he's just trying to push me around. With a 4TTKT board. I decide that if he had a K, he wouldn't have checked the turn. And with three 10s on the board, unlikely he had that in his starting hand. With the combo of the overbet and unlikely scenario of having a 10 in his hand, I call.  He shows AT off suit. I lose.

Should I have played this hand differently?

&amp;#x200B;

Notably, I faced him again later in a similar situation, as follows (and lost again):

I'm on the UTG with 89s(hearts). I call $5. Next guy folds. My nemesis raised to $20. Everyone else folds and I call.

Flop comes out 7h Jh Jd.  This gives me a ton of outs, but I'm hoping to get a free card.  I check. He bets $15. I call. 

Turn is another 7. We both check.

River is a 5h.  I have a flush. He bets $95 into a $75 pot.  I call.  He shows Ts Js. Wins with a boat against my flush. But it's hard to get away from a flush unless you can put him on a 7 or J. Unlikely to have a 7 since he pre flop raised. 

Obviously, I played this wrong. But what would've been a better way given that it was hard to decipher whether he had a J.",1609047615

1. Made a deposit started playing and then a week later was told that my account is suspended. They told me I needed to verify my account in order to keep playing. That alone is enough to show they can't be trusted because they should do that FIRST before they accept a deposit. 
2. Then they cancelled my credit card transaction and said they sent the funds back to the card. This left me with a negative balance and I now owed them money. 
3. Then when I support contacted me about verification and my account, ""magically"" my account was no longer suspended. Obviously they knew if they suspended my account that I wouldn't be able to make a deposit so they didn't give me any explination and just responded with ""your account isn't suspended"". 
4. Then I made another deposit and started playing when I get an e-mail that says we have confiscated funds from your account. We apologize for any inconvenience. No explination, no warning, just took the money. 
5. I have had a couple technical problems with the software as well that I made a complaint about there response was for me to send them a video even though I sent them my hand history and said I would said all my hand histories to verify that this was a technical glitch. When I asked them how I am supposed to take a video and recreate a technical glitch in the software, they sent me an email saying that the claim was closed and wanted my feedback. 
6. I used a deposit bonus which gave me 100% match and then I also get rakeback. This is false advertising because you can't get a bonus and rakeback at the same time. So if you have rakeback and you earn a bonus, the bonus is taken out of your rakeback. So they pay you with your own money. It's not a bonus. 
7. I finished on theThe Beast leaderboard and was supposed to have been given entry to a tournament. My account said that the tournament will take place on December 26 at 6pm EST and so when I logged on today, I couldn't find the tournament anywhere. Could not find a tournament with my name on it so I contacted support and spent 90 mins only to be told that my tournament wasn't on the 26 but it was on January 3. That took 90 mins to get that information and then when I asked for more information, he said he didn't have it. 
8. My friend signed up on the site and made a depost 4 days ago, tried to make a withdrawal and she isn't allowed to. She continues to get an error that says ""please wait 72 hours after a deposit to make a withdrawal"". She made her deposit almost a week ago and it has been well over the 72 hour mark. 

Sorry if that is too much too read and I don't blame anyone who doesn't read it but if you want the cliff notes, stay away from Winning Poker Network and it doesn't matter whether it's America's Cardroom or BlackChip Poker or whatever other skins they have because they will steal your money.

Then when you have as many people who think that the cards are rigged to boost the rake, it's practically impossible for any rational, sane person to see the way they operate with withdrawals and bonuses and not think that they are completely trustworthy and the RNG I'm sure is on the up and up. I don't think I'll ever get my money out of that account. I didn't want anyone to learn the hard way like I did. Stay away from WPN.",1609034654

We're over just over 200bb deep effectively so factoring that in I assume villains calling range oop is going to be pretty strong. Suited broadways, low suited connectors and all pocket pairs.

Flop, I bet half to get some thin value from all the draws he could have, Qx, and if he doesn't wanna fold with a pocketpair for some reason. 

Facing the raise I feel it's a mandatory call on this bored. But his value range is pretty narrow at this point. I have the Kh, so there's 1 remaining combo of KQsuited. And then two combos of pocket 6's.

Then the turned 6 narrowed his value range even more to only two value hands. 1 combo 6s, 1 combo KQs. I felt that any draw had priced himself in and I should jam to make sure I get everything on the times he does have a draw.

Basically I'm looking at run it once vs plo mastermind. I have a fairly decent idea of what mastermind has to offer, but what I'm really interested in is a GTO approach and working with solvers. 

I kind of understand the basics of RIO vs Mastermind in that most people say mastermind is more structured vs RIO, but i am not finding much more information about the comparisons between the two.  

Basically I'm looking for more advanced talk, more math, strategy and solver work vs the ""you can be a crusher if you work hard, you go girl you got this!!"" Type talk.  

Can anyone who used both mastermind and run it once give me a little insight about the differences and similarities, but maybe a bit more in depth than some of the other information out there?

6460,Bad turn bet with AA?,poker,"In a large field small stakes MTT tournament near the registration bubble, have managed to spin up the late registration to 65 bbs, and haven't caught a hand for a round or two. Meanwhile, villain in this hand has been going crazy for the last two rounds, including a button reshove for 30bbs with A9 os that hit running 9s to put a nasty bad beat on an AK that open min-raised UTG. Obviously, I don't think too highly of villain's play, but haven't found a hand to play with him, when I'm dealt AhAc in the cutoff; both villain and I have 66-67 bbs at start of hand, he minraises from UTG+2 and I 3-bet small to 6.5 bbs. I want him in there, I don't think he's going to 4bet me here unless he has a big pair but if he does this sizing should induce it, and I have already seen him be spewy. 

He calls, the flop comes Ks6s3d. Beautiful flop, I never put him on a king better than KQ honestly, and I want to get all the money in. He check calls my 7.2 BB bet, which I'm thinking is fine. The Qd turn is where it gets tricky; with 30 BBs in the pot and 54 BBs behind, I go for 1/2 pot again. I know I'll be in an awkward spot on the river, but I'm just not folding to this guy, perhaps even if a spade comes. It comes 9D and he shoves, I call, he of course shows the AdJd, which is a gut punch. I know he's never folding this hand anyway unless I went all-in on the flop, and the fact he called the flop leads me to believe he's bluffing the river if he misses. 

So I guess the issue is the turn; should it just be between a pot sized bet or shove or a check back/evaluate the river strategy? The more I think about it, I believe the turn should be a mix of all-in or checking. I probably avoid getting stacked on the river anytime I am beat or get drawn out on, and could potentially make a hero fold on some rivers if the villain does overbet shove. I still can get value from some bluffs or make a value bet if he checks again on a good river. I just hate this spot in general, because the conditions of the pot going to the turn were so favorable to my range, I would take this scenario every day and twice on Sunday, yet when it turns into disaster you are left really shaking your head. Ah well, back to the grind. Any advice appreciated.",1609001629

This is a very weird move by villain, just shipping it all in on the flop. All ins tend to be nutted so I start going through all the value hands villain could have here. Top pair which I beat, bottom set and middle set as well. KJ here is also VERY likely. I have the spade blocker which lowers the odds of villiain bluffing with a flush draw (but it also gives me the backdoor flush draw for slight equity if I go in bad). All in all I thought it was a close decision between calling and folding, but villain is going to be shoving with enough top pair to make it worthwhile I thought. Is my thought process wrong?

UTG is a solid player (TAG) whose stack is 45$. He open raises to 1.00$

I'm right next to him and decide to re-raise to 2.50$ with AcKd. Everyone else (including the blinds) fold and he decides to make the call.  

The flop comes up 8d 10c Kc and he checks to me. Seeing as how I hold the Ac I decide to try to play things a bit tricky and check back. The goal here was to try to make him think I had QQ or JJ and was afraid of the K on the flop. 

The turn card is Ks and he bets 3.33$ into the \~5.50$ pot. Trying to pull off a bluff I decide to re-raise 8.50$ and he makes the call. 

The river card ends up being Qc and there's now roughly 21.00$ in the pot. Villain bets 14.00$ and I decide to make the call. He shows AsJc and wins the hand with a straight.

6476,Sitting out in Live Tournament?,poker,"If we play poker tournament online and we sit out (voluntary or not), we will simply be folding automatically until the blinds and/or antes force us all in and allow us to win the hand in that all-in scenario.  Because of this, people who sit out can end up cashing, having pay jump, even eliminate someone else if their chips cover them, (might technically win if he wins non-stop and blind jump high enough to cover his opponent; can also happen if two people end up sitting out heads up until they are both all-in, LOL), etc.  Basically, it is like playing but folding every hand until blinds force you all in.

Now in live, I am doing searches, and saw that some casino handle it that way, some might disqualify you if you say you leave and you are not coming back, some might disqualify you automatically if you are sitting-out/not-playing for X orbits, etc.  I can imagine all sort of rules applied.

Regarding all this.  Is there any official poker rules?  Is there an authority responsible to define those rules?  Or have there be an attempt to do this?  I guess we could take for example WSOP rules (they must have some kind of defined rules for all these details).

Do you know if some live tournament would apply the rules exactly as in online... making you muck until blinds force you all in and allow you to have the same possibility of winning something?

I am interested to know all cases you know in practice regarding this (even if I ""believe"" that this situation has more chance to occur online than in live, I am sure there are situation where someone has to leave ""live"" and so, we have to decide what we do with it).

Some players feel it is unfair someone not playing can earn something in the end.

6488,Betting for Protection/Denying Equity is a Fallacy,poker,"  I read a lot of posts where Hero flops TP with a J or T, bets pot and states that his reasoning was betting for protection so that Villain will fold out his over cards. Lets say that Hero is in the LJ with TT and opens, CO calls. Hero has an over pair on the flop. Lets put Villains' preflop range aside for a moment. In this instance Hero is worried about over cards.  Lets say that Villain has two over cards to Hero's Tens. That's leaves 14 cards that Hero doesn't want to see on the turn. There's \~30% chance that one of those cards will hit on the turn. Villain has 6 outs. There's a \~12% that one of his cards will appear on the turn. It would be a mistake for Villain to call even a 25%PSB. Our goal should be to win the battle of mistakes against our opponents. We should always strive to identify and take the highest +EV line.  In this example we should be betting for value a size that we expect or at least hope will be called. That we have denied equity to our Villain is a byproduct of betting for Value. 

  Here's another example. We're on the flop with what we believe to be the best hand with QQ. The flop contains both straight and flush draws.  We make a 75%PSB. Do we want Villain to fold his flush or straight  draw? Hell no! By calling Villain is taking a terrible price. His call is -EV. But let's say that we only bet 40%PSB. Is Villain still making a mistake? Yes, even with the flush draw. At this point we need to do an EV calculation to see which bet size is the highest EV. Obviously you aren't going to call a time out as you open the calculator app on your phone and run the equations for the different bet sizes. Both of these bet sizes deny the opponent equity. But if you know that your opponent is far more likely to call the smaller bet then thats what you bet.  

 In both of these examples we denied equity; but our goal was to extract value from our opponent.  To some this may seem like semantics.  But when you can look at betting or raising from a perspective of what is the highest +EV line it will be one more thing that gets you closer to playing a different game than your opponents. Too often betting for protection/denying equity is just an excuse. It's code for ""I'm scared to play poker"". Too often we bet for protection hoping for a fold when we should be hoping for a call.  Too often we bet to deny equity without thinking of what size is the maximum EV. Put your big boy pants on and put down your purse down. You are at the table to play poker. 

  You bet one unit less than your opponent will fold to when you want them to call. You bet one unit more than your opponent is willing to call when you want them to fold. Does it always work out. No, thats poker. Sometimes your opponent will surprise you. But if he is surprising you often; then you've done a bad job of observing him.",1608957151

6495,Is It More Profitable to Fold until ITM in Spots Like This?,poker,"There were 260 left and top 252 are ITM. Since I could've folded into the money, and the pay jumps aren't very big (relative to min cash) for a long time, should I be looking to get the just about guaranteed money? To get 2x a min cash I'd need to get to top 99. There are good payouts at the top of course - $3300 for 1st, top 4 are 1k+, but the pay jumps are smaller then a min cash until at the final 2 tables.

It feels like in these big field tournaments, when short stacked but in a position to fold into the money, it is more profitable to just fold into the money.

I intend to play some bigger buy-in live MTT's in a tour together with a friend of similar skill level and want to offer him to swap points to reduce variance.

But I've never done this before and don't know how this works exactly. Do the percentages change if one of us does a (or more) rebuy(s) and the other one doesn't?

6498,Two NL5z 3bet pots with marginal top pair,poker,"Had me some spots with top pair in 3bet pots (one as aggressor, one as caller).

**Hand 1: Ignition 10NL 6max regular table, maybe nit fold**

SB is the effective stack with $12.69, seems a little tight but w/e it's anonymous and it's only been 30 hands.

Preflop: I open CO ($24.15) to $0.30 with J9dd, SB ($12.69) 3bets to $1, only I call.

Flop (\~$2.10): Jc4c2d. SB bets $1.70, I call.

Turn (\~$5.50): Tc. SB bets $3.

Preflop might be a bit loose, but the 3b is on the small side, so seems ok. Flop, I probably have to call most pairs in spite of the bet because so much of SB's hands missed. Probably doing very little raising on that flop in general, so on the turn we still have our flushes, sets, and JTs.

Not feeling great with the J9s. SB seems to be in the value mood. Probably facing a river shove. Blockers are garbage. Unlikely but I could be drawing dead. I think I just fold J9s here though that might be a bit exploitable, and probably fold KJs on the river. I get to go to the river pretty strong and feel ok facing a shove. Thoughts?

**Hand 2: Ignition 5NL 6max Zone, x/c with TP2K**

I'm the effective stack with $4.80 because I didn't reload in time.

Preflop: CO rando opens to $0.10, I 3bet SB to $0.40 with KJcc, only CO calls.

Flop (\~$0.85): 8cJh3h. I check/call $0.25.

Turn (\~$1.30): 6h completing a potential flush. I check/call $1.30.

River (\~$3.88): Tc. Check, CO bets $2.86.

Seems like a neutral flop (assuming I 3bet something like 77+/X9s+/AJo+/KQo+). I lean toward value betting most of my AJ+ and checking everything else, but maybe a small bet is okay. Turn, maybe some people find a fold but I don't have a lot of hands better than one pair as played. River improves JTs and my sticky TT and I have some very occasional slowplays, but for the most part I don't show up with anything better than KJ.",1608947687

Hero UTG ($4.95) opens to $0.15 with KdKc, UTG+1 ($3.66) and SB ($4.65) flat.

Turn ($0.48): 8c. SB bets $0.51, hero calls, UTG+1 calls.

River (\~$2): 2c. SB bets $1.45.

Even when not multiway I should be checking this flop very often (maybe a mistake against fish since I miss value and have no idea how good I am?), so I will have better hands to call the turn. Maybe I should just fold, idk.

SB still bets pretty big into two players on the river, but they didn't size to pot on a brick which might be a bit of a tell (and honestly both players seem sort of fishy so I find it a bit more difficult to give either of them credit for a hand).

Everyone's strategy became wait until you get a decent hand and then call his all in. I stacked him with king nine suited, pocket sixes, and pocket queens. The only all-in I lost was my pocket sixes to his five seven off, because he hit two fives on the flop and turn.

6519,Big 370bb Pot: Looking for Advice,poker,"Just wanted to get some feedback and see whether or not I should have folded this river. 50nl Zone, Ignition 6-max

UTG folds, Villain UTG +1 (186bb effective) raises to 3bb, hero in CO 3bets to 9bb with KdKh. Everyone else folds, Villain calls. Heads up to the flop.

Flop: Td Tc 6s

Villain checks, hero c-bets 6bb, villain calls.

Turn: Td Tc 6s 6d

Villain leads for 30bb

At this point, I believe villains extremely polarized, having either the nuts or air. Thinking about combos, he could reasonably have TT or 66 here, buts that's only 1 combo of each. Unlikely that he has any 6x (could see maybe 56s but I doubt he's raising that in EP). He has some Tx, but most likely it's only suited broadways and T9s, plus I block KTs.

Hero calls

River: Td Tc 6s 6d 9h

Villain leads for 139.7 bb and is essentially all in. Hero???

Once again, this is very polarized. I think it's hard to find many bluffs here. I could see villain thinking this is a value bet with JJ or QQ putting me on AK, and 99 gets there on the river. I heavily block AK, so I think that's unlikely, and he's probably 4-betting aces pre.

I’m now considering abandoning my current job in order to play full time, which has been a dream of mine for roughly 10 years. 
Here is what I’m struggling with: I have always been a winning poker player but have also struggled with gambling issues. Mainly issues with blackjack and slots. The typical casino visit for me would usually result in a win of $300-1k in poker followed by a substantial loss in blackjack or slots. Am I only winning at this rate because way more people are looking to play during the covid era? Is the player pool much weaker than it would be in different times? Will the player pool dry up as casinos and poker rooms open back up?

Also, I understand the arguments for moving up in stakes. I actually have no desire to do this. Basically I believe my playing style is incredibly exploitable by savvy opponents. My style is largely weighted towards limping preflop. Lot of overbets, check raising. I probably fold a bunch of winning hands, but the trade off is I am never putting in large % of stack without nuts or near nuts. I feel this greatly limits my potential winnings, but also really prevents big losses.

The third player involved in the hand had about 17 million (28 bb). CL at the table is to my right. I haven't really see the Villain get out of line in the half hour or so of play. Seems to be a solid player based on his charts. 8 handed table, action is as follows:

From MP, Villain raises the action up to 1.4M. From the HJ, Hero looks down at 10s 10c and calls 1.4M. SB completes, three ways to the flop. Pot: 5M

Flop: \[4d 7s 10d\] 

SB checks, prompting Villain to bet 2.3M. Hero decides to just call 2.3M and SB folds immediately. Pot: 9.5M

Turn: \[4d 7s 10d\] \[4s\]

Villain checks. Hero checks back. Pot: 9.5M

River: \[4d 7s 10d\] \[4s\] \[Kd\]

But because i know i cant compete in online poker (lets be honest, there where the money is made, in highstakes, your AVERAGE player is 8/10) 

So what did i do? 

Because i know that the level of poker in casinos is higher (tbh still way lower then in online) i found a wild, home game. And i am not joking, this is money printing.

Following situation, i am at the button, i raise 4bb he reraises, i would say he is a very loose player, and not good, i all in, he calls

I have KK he has K3 offsuit. I logically win. And such situations happen ""offen"". 


A 5/10 who knows where the fish are is making more money then a 8/10 player who goes to the normal spots.


We are like 8-9 people at the table i am not joking

Around 4-5 off them are really bad players. They dont even know about the importance of positioning for example.

Opponent selection is important, you have to find the oldschool guys between 40-50 who just never studied poker but just play it.",1608862417

This is where my question comes in. WTF DO I DO. The sb and bb had around 2x my stack each. I was debating whether to fold and go for the pay jump or call and go for a 3rd or 4th place stack. I was incentivized to fold given I had just been in the blinds and would have had multiple opportunities to get another hand in in a less sick spot, but I flatted after using my whole time bank, SB insta fold BB insta fold and UTG shows me A3o. 

3 on flop, 
3 on turn, 
3 on river.

Flop comes 2h 5h Kc

I check, he bets about half pot ($17). I check raise to $45. He 3 bets to $111.63

I have just under $12,000 in live tournament winnings ($11,374 if it had to be an exact figure), and after tournament buy-ins totaling $6000, I have a total net profit of $5,374, for a 47% ROI (Approximately 100 tournaments played, averaging $60 a tournament buy-in)

Since the beginning of October I have started playing online micro MTT's on Pokerstars (mainly the $0.25 45 and 90 player MTT SNG's they offer. Looking to bankroll 150-250 BI's to $1 versions of these plus the 180 player SNG's by the end of next summer) and have compiled a small sample of tournament data in that time. I would like to get any kind of thought or critique/constructive criticism on how I am doing so far for my online tournament play. I have purchased Poker Copilot, the $7 introductory course on post-flop play on upswing poker, and I'm curious to know how my poker book ""Mastering Small Stakes No Limit Hold'em Cash Games and Tournaments"" by Johnathan Little holds up strategy wise these days. Great information in that book from what I've seen so far, but yeah. I have a 33k hand sample obtained so far. Between these stats and what my Pokerprolabs player account information has provided me, here are my following stats and I would simply like to know if it possible to tell if I am playing well, or on a really good heater right now.

Hand Total: 33,585

Tournaments played: 470

Total Winnings: $186.26

Total Tournament cost: $115.70

Total Profit: $70.56

Average profit per tournament: $0.13

Second Place: 20

Third Place: 11

4-Bet: 16%

C-bet: 56%

Check-Raise: 6%

All-In Equity: +4700BB over 33,585 hands

All-In Equity Value: +3400BB over 33,585 hands

Poker Copilot Leak Detectors over 33,585 Hands

Pre-Flop Aggression: Everything is listed as good except Big blind as ""passive"" at 35%. ""Raise more, call less""

Positional Awareness: All listed as ""Good""

Blind Stealing: Attempt Rate: 44% (Good) BB won/100 hands from blind steal attempts: 82.12 BB won/overall: 14.05

Pocket Pairs: Everything listed has a positive BB won/100 hands with the exception of pocket 6's at -23.13 BB/100 (Notably, my AA and KK both have +1200BB /100, is this normal?)

Suited Connectors: AK and KQ suited have +172 and +170 BB/100 respectively, everything else is basically canceling each other out. Would like to improve my JTs -75.33 BB/100.

I check back the flop, which in retrospect was a really stupid move. This is probably why I got called down on the turn. Maybe I should start checking back the nuts more so I can exploit light calls like this.

The turn is a brick and villain decides to barrel large. Normally I would just fold here but I decide to mix things up with a raise. Villain makes a large raise but not all in, which is usually just a bluff raise to get you to fold. I call his bluff and shove all in because villain never has the goods here.

I flop with an OESD. this is ok for me but villain is being aggressive which leads me to believe he has some sort of AK, KQ, KJ type hands. The price is right so I call though.   


Turn (45 BB, 2 players):

River (77.8 BB, 2 players):

I could bluff here definitely but I have no hearts in my hand, which means it's possible villain could be trapping with a flush. Also given the aggression on the flop and turn, villain likely has a fairly strong hand that won't fold easily on the river. I opt to check back and just give up the pot.

POSTFLOP THOUGHTS: I posted this because I am currently a combination TAG/NIT player trying to evolve into a LAG style to completely eliminate the ""they always have me beat"" mentality. I did not feel as sick as I normally would getting about this, but my question is: Could I have found a fold here, or is this just a ""sigh-click"" cooler??  I have noticed, however, that TT and JJ are quickly becoming trouble hands for me playing from the SB, because in another tournament I faced an UTG raise and a 3-Bet from the Button with TT in the SB and I was completely fucking stumped on what to do (completely different stage of tournament, etc) so I erred on the side of caution and folded.

I had a hard time deciding whether to check or bet, but decided to check because the backdoor flush draw made my hand less vulnerable, and it's less likely that villain has a flush draw. All of a sudden the short stack shoves. I was planning on slowplaying this hand, but facing a shove was calling the right move? Sure I have reasonably high equity, but villain will shove with middle pair strong kicker+. 2 pairs, sets, and literally every combo of king are all possible (T5 offsuit wouldn't surprise me at all).

 9d  
SB checks, **Hero bets 20 BB**, SB calls 20 BB

Turn is pretty much a brick although if villain had pocket 9s specifically they hit a set I guess? Villain weirdly checks, so I go for a small bet hoping to ramp it up on the river. I have to worry about flush draws so I make sure it's decently sized.

SB bets 57.2 BB and is all-in, **Hero calls 57.2 BB**

River is a diamond and suddenly villain goes all in which gives me pause. But it's an ace of diamond, which really widens villain's shoving range. While they will be shoving with hands like QJd and JTd and AJd and ATd and AQd  their flush range is verrrry small given that they checked the turn and 3-bet preflop (very unlikely that they have any suited combo with a pair of kings at this point). if villain floated with any Ace combo suited or not they are shoving here.

6623,They never bluff the micros.....except they do bluff all the time,poker,"I used to think that they never bluff in the micros. After calling down a couple of gutsy bluffs I now realize that I was horribly wrong. If you're always betting like a maniac with your strong hands of course they never bluff you when you're strong, because they think you also call down like a maniac. They don't bluff you when you're strong because it just isn't profitable. They don't bluff when the board is scary and nuttish because they're AFRAID of being called down with the nuts. The nuts is their biggest enemy, because it's the only hand nits are comfortable calling down with. They bluff the boards where the nuts doesn't exist. They bluff the spots where you don't have the nuts, or at least not enough of the time because your ranges aren't balanced at all.  They bluff when you are weak and they fold when you are strong, this is how they play against nitty TAGs. 

It's also interesting to note hand selection when bluffing. They bluff with the types of hands that have mediocre showdown value but CRUSH the weak hands you have. So they bluff you, but you can't bluff catch because you don't have hands strong enough to beat their mediocre ones. It's almost a value bluff? They value bet the hands that have your passive lines crushed but are too weak to bet otherwise.  I'm slowly starting to realize why balance is important and how you need to hide the nuts in every line whether passive or aggressive. 

While their bluffs are very effective against thinking players, against players that think even more they're incredibly easy to see through. Whenever you're in a spot and see a huge bet and have a hard time thinking of what nuts your opponent can have, they're probably bluffing because they don't have the nuts and they know you don't either. Don't be scared to call down with less than the nuts because they do bluff you....just not at the spots you would expect. Also be sure to hide the nuts in every possible lines so you can call down these spots comfortable even with 2nd pair. 

Wait maybe they aren't bluffing....maybe they're value betting????",1608422459

Some dude calls, and then this CO guy decides to shove it all in...which gives me some pause considering the large open. What hands is he shoving here? All pocket pairs TT+. AKo and AKs, AQs SOMETIMES, probably never shoving AJs. If I had pocket queens it would be a far easier call, but against a shoving range like this do I have enough equity to make the call?  


CO wins 40 BB

Is villain going to shove here with dominated underpairs sometimes? Yes. This is why I'm starting to believe my fold here was too nitty, even if I'm risking half my stack with JJ preflop. Thoughts on my play?",1608395328

Probably the best turn card ever came. I don't want to scare away villain's underpairs with a 3/4 bet though. I bet half pot, and villain calls.   


River (34.2 BB, 2 players):  
 As  
BB checks, **Hero bets 16.4 BB**, BB calls 16.4 BB

This is where I start to think my turn bet was too small. What if villain was passively playing a king? How do I get 3 streets of value? I stew for a bit about the right size, and go for half pot. Should I have gone for a more polarizing 3/4 pot size instead?

UTG raises to 3 BB, CO calls 3 BB, BTN calls 3 BB, SB calls 2.6 BB, **Hero calls 2 BB**

This was a really tough spot with pocket 8s. On one hand, all these juicy callers that I would love to squeeze value out of. On the other hand, 8s are a middling pocket pair so there is a high chance the board is full of overcards and I'm forced to fold. With pocket 9s I would probably 3-bet more often than I flat, but it's a bit of a dicey decision with 8s. Do I 3-bet here? Do I flat?

I get probably the best flop I can hope for and manage to screw it up. I check first in case anyone has any flushes they'll shove, and one guy decides to bet. I check raise. Was that the correct decision, or should I have just flatted here?

**Dealt to Hero:**  
 AcJc  


*fold*, **Hero raises to 3 BB**, *fold*, SB raises to 10 BB, *fold*, **Hero calls 7 BB**

I open fairly early and get 3 bet by the SB. This gives me pause, even with a hand as strong as AJc. Obviously I shouldn't be folding here, but there is a high chance villain has a strong pair or has my AJ dominated by AQ, AK type hands.   


Flop (21 BB, 2 players):  
 Ks6c2d  
SB bets 6.6 BB, **Hero calls 6.6 BB**

The flop is very very dry, and AK obviously hit a home run here. I debate whether to call or fold here, but the bet is pretty small. Should I always be folding everything less than AK/Strong equity underpairs?   


Turn (34.2 BB, 2 players):  
 Kc  
SB checks, **Hero bets 14 BB**, SB calls 14 BB

The turn is Kc and vilain checks. If I'm going to bluff them off of whatever small pair they have, now is the time. I go big for around half pot, but it apparently wasn't big enough as a I get snap called.   


River (62.2 BB, 2 players):  
 9c  
SB bets 14 BB, ***fold***

The river is a brick, and I screwed up my only chance to take down the pot. Villain is leading here which is saying 1 of 2 things. I have an underpair but don't want to call an aggressively large bet. Or 2, I have the king and I'm inviting a bluff raise. I screwed up my only bluff oppurtunity, if I was gonna get villain to fold their underpair the turn was the time to do it. Even if I shoved all in here, I'm pretty sure villain would call with JJ, QQ, TT type hands. The only hands I am getting to fold here would be very small pocket pairs, but they probably would fold to the turn bet. I take the loss and fold. Was the river bluff the right play, or should I have gone larger/checked back?

BB checks, **Hero bets 2.2 BB**, BB raises to 9.4 BB, **Hero calls 7.2 BB**

I bet because top pair and pretty small because there aren't going to be a lot of straight draws here. I get raised which puts me on pause. How often is villain going to be raising me here with a flopped set vs bluffing with a flush draw? I decided to call. 

Turn (25.2 BB, 2 players):  
 9s  
BB bets 16 BB, **Hero calls 16 BB**

The turn is pretty much a blank although 10 8 suited makes the straight I guess? I decide to call again and reevaluate on the river.

Now villain fires big again on the river. If I'm going to find a fold, the river is where I do it. What hands would be bet like this? Bluffs obviously. All of Villain's flush draw bluffs have made it, and his sets have a full house now (not that it matters I was dominated either way). Villain will value bet some of their stronger Jacks like this, like their 2 pairs and AJ, KJ, QJ type hands. But it is clear at this point that villain is not bluffing. Do I beat enough of villain's value betting range to make the call here, or should I just fold?",1608388344

I’m UTG (1200 stack) and have AA. I open to 35 and a woman in middle position (1600-1700 stack) raises to 100.

This woman has yet to re-raise and is an older woman who claimed earlier in the night she hasn’t played in awhile. She essentially has a TAG playing style. Right away I’m putting her on a premium JJ-KK type of hand. 

It folds to me and I’m trying to figure out the proper raise size and in my head 3-betting to 300 sounds like the play. I grab 4 greens and accidentally grab 3 blacks as well and raise to 400....

She doesn’t tank long and ends up folding the hand. And I feel like I pretty much had AA written on my forehead. Afterwards I was thinking that I should have just announced “Raise, 300 total”. But I never announce my raises and I feel doing that would have also showed a ton of strength.

I just wanted to ask everyone’s opinion on the proper raise size here and your thoughts as well on announcing raise amounts and how much that portrays strength.

Not sure what the correct play is here or if this is just one of those spots where you kinda throw your hands up and guess.  First action I think all three options suck.  JJ is too weak to raise (I'd 4bet QQ), but too strong to fold (I'd fold TT), and calling a 3bet OOP is shitty, in fact I think it's pretty clear that I've got pocket Jacks when I do that (or AQ?), regardless I think it might be the best play?  As for the second action, CO flatting the open kinda cuts AA/KK out of their range, then again this is on Ignition where people act very strangely, I think you do see QQ+ in this spot sometimes.  My \*guess\* is that this is some broadway AJ+ type hand, but it's hard to say because I don't really have any range whatsoever for this play, and neither should anyone else

They were on the bubble, and one guy had over the average chip count, and another that had probably double what he had. Well the guy with double pushes all in, and the guy who’s at risk of being eliminated has pocket aces. He thinks for a while, and folds. When I was a younger poker player I thought this play was so dumb... now that I’m older I always debate it with myself.

Villain check raises to $265.  

I tank for a while wondering if he could have flatted my raise with Aces or flopped a set of 9s.  In my head I was thinking queens or jacks wouldn’t normally check raise in this situation and would just try to get to show down.  Potentially I thought he could be check raising with a combo draw like Jh10h. 

Eventually I decide if he has me beat then whatever and I ship it all in and he snap calls with QQ.  

My Kings hold and I scoop the pot.  The villain said he can’t believe I even tanked in that spot and should have been an insta shove but I disagree.

But the problem is, most of the games I'm playing are DC, with PLO being a much larger part than NLHE. I'm able to beat the games, since the level is horrendous and people are making huge mistakes. But I know I'm not good in it.

The problem is, I'm hesitant to throw like $1k for an online course to learn the game. I'm also used to learning from books, so if there's a good book on PLO, that's my preferred starting point. I've read the Jeff Hwang books, and they were real good for the time, but that was a long time ago, and a lot of what they teach seem to be outdated. I'm curious if there's a more GTO based strategy book available on Omaha?

My understanding is that I prefer waiting for the CO position because then I’ll have position post-flop if I want to play the hand, vs posting in the SB. 

The player next to me says it’s better to post in the SB because you have position pre-flop.

My play style, which I believe is important in determining necessary bankroll, is naturally a more low-variance tight/aggressive (pushing into tight/weak self-admittedly) territory. If I wanted to add a few thousand to the 2-3K I have now, how do you think my play style will adapt? 

I haven't lost a deep buy in yet, and I feel like it would demolish my bankroll. Evidently, I believe I should be. It's poker, and I believe it's inevitable and fine as long as you're getting your money in good. I feel like I'm not fully exploiting the spots I need to be that would let me maximize profit because they're higher-variance/risk plays. Is it smart to add more money to my bankroll and take riskier lines to be able to profit more?

So many limpers...SO MANY LIMPERS. I raise to around 5BB but it apparently isn't enough because the pot goes 4 ways. I am not loving this because AQo doesn't play very good multiway unless I'm facing medium pocket pairs that refuse to fold. There are many many bad flops and when I hit it's so obvious they fold most of their junk.

BB checks, UTG checks, MP bets 4 BB, **Hero raises to 17.8 BB**, *fold*, UTG calls 17.8 BB, MP calls 13.8 BB

The flop is OK for me but anyone could have a flopped straight here and there is a high chance someone has a straight or flush draw (sometimes both). This small bet is obviously just to get odds on a draw so I raise to get value, but was this the right move?

Probably the worst card ever comes on the turn and the small stack shoves. Obviously I have to fold, in a 4-way pot they GOTTA have a flush or pocket 2s or maybe even QJ for all I know.

Turn (7.2 BB, 2 players):

This card is pretty good for me but what am I getting called by if I bet? The pot is small and it will just fold out all of villain's hands that could call my river bets or would c-bet the turn big

 7d  
**Hero bets 5.2 BB**, BTN raises to 22.6 BB, ***fold***

Because of the turn check I should have all sorts of bluffs here, so villain will call with pretty much whatever pair they have or maybe even A high sometimes. I get a HUGE raise here though so I think for a moment what hands would be raising me like this after potting the flop and checking the turn. Straight draws, that ended up hitting on the river, or maybe pocket 7s that just spiked a set. Villain isn't going to bluffing here nearly enough for a call to profitable, I thought so I just folded. Was this a correct laydown.

 Ah9s2h  
SB bets 2 BB and is all-in, **Hero raises to 23.6 BB**, UTG calls 23.6 BB

I pretty much have the nuts here so I make a reasonably large raise to pot. I want to charge draws and get value from weak pocket pairs that are too stubborn to fold. Shoving here would be bad because there's a chance Villain has pocket 9s or very rarely A2/A9, but is this raise size too large??

Let's say instead of calling my raise villain decided to shove. Do I ever fold here? While villain could technically have 2 pair or a set, I block Aces and pocket 9s are going to be only a small part of villain's shoving range.   


Turn (75.2 BB, 3 players):  
 Js  
**Hero bets 72.8 BB and is all-in**, UTG calls 72.8 BB

The turn card is pretty good for me. There's a CHANCE villain just got a set of jacks but their flush draws have lost a lot of their equity and a straight here is impossible. I think for a bit before shoving it in, but couldn't I have just make another large bet instead? Was shoving the turn the right play?

This is a pretty standard open.   


Flop (7 BB, 2 players):

I check back the flop, which in retrospect was a really stupid move. This is probably why I got called down on the turn. Maybe I should start checking back the nuts more so I can exploit light calls like this.

 3s  
SB bets 5.2 BB, **Hero raises to 13.8 BB**, SB raises to 39.6 BB, **Hero raises to 140 BB and is all-in**, SB calls 58 BB and is all-in

The turn is a brick and villain decides to barrel large. Normally I would just fold here but I decide to mix things up with a raise. Villain makes a large raise but not all in, which is usually just a bluff raise to get you to fold. I call his bluff and shove all in because villain never has the goods here.

Flop (25 BB, 2 players):

I flop with an OESD. this is ok for me but villain is being aggressive which leads me to believe he has some sort of AK, KQ, KJ type hands. The price is right so I call though.   


Turn (45 BB, 2 players):

Villain won't have a lot of Ts in his range, except maybe ATs or KTs. The bet is fairly large but the price is right so I call again.   


River (77.8 BB, 2 players):  
 7h  
SB checks, **Hero checks**

I could bluff here definitely but I have no hearts in my hand, which means it's possible villain could be trapping with a flush. Also given the aggression on the flop and turn, villain likely has a fairly strong hand that won't fold easily on the river. I opt to check back and just give up the pot.

I have noticed, however, that TT and JJ are quickly becoming trouble hands for me playing from the SB, because in another tournament I faced an UTG raise and a 3-Bet from the Button with TT in the SB and I was completely fucking stumped on what to do (completely different stage of tournament, etc) so I erred on the side of caution and folded.

I had a hard time deciding whether to check or bet, but decided to check because the backdoor flush draw made my hand less vulnerable, and it's less likely that villain has a flush draw. All of a sudden the short stack shoves. I was planning on slowplaying this hand, but facing a shove was calling the right move?

Turn is pretty much a brick although if villain had pocket 9s specifically they hit a set I guess? Villain weirdly checks, so I go for a small bet hoping to ramp it up on the river. I have to worry about flush draws so I make sure it's decently sized.

River is a diamond and suddenly villain goes all in which gives me pause. But it's an ace of diamond, which really widens villain's shoving range. While they will be shoving with hands like QJd and JTd and AJd and ATd and AQd  their flush range is verrrry small given that they checked the turn and 3-bet preflop (very unlikely that they have any suited combo with a pair of kings at this point). if villain floated with any Ace combo suited or not they are shoving here.

6823,They never bluff the micros.....except they do bluff all the time,poker,"I used to think that they never bluff in the micros. After calling down a couple of gutsy bluffs I now realize that I was horribly wrong. If you're always betting like a maniac with your strong hands of course they never bluff you when you're strong, because they think you also call down like a maniac. They don't bluff you when you're strong because it just isn't profitable. They don't bluff when the board is scary and nuttish because they're AFRAID of being called down with the nuts. The nuts is their biggest enemy, because it's the only hand nits are comfortable calling down with. They bluff the boards where the nuts doesn't exist. They bluff the spots where you don't have the nuts, or at least not enough of the time because your ranges aren't balanced at all.  They bluff when you are weak and they fold when you are strong, this is how they play against nitty TAGs. 

It's also interesting to note hand selection when bluffing. They bluff with the types of hands that have mediocre showdown value but CRUSH the weak hands you have. So they bluff you, but you can't bluff catch because you don't have hands strong enough to beat their mediocre ones. It's almost a value bluff? They value bet the hands that have your passive lines crushed but are too weak to bet otherwise.  I'm slowly starting to realize why balance is important and how you need to hide the nuts in every line whether passive or aggressive. 

While their bluffs are very effective against thinking players, against players that think even more they're incredibly easy to see through. Whenever you're in a spot and see a huge bet and have a hard time thinking of what nuts your opponent can have, they're probably bluffing because they don't have the nuts and they know you don't either. Don't be scared to call down with less than the nuts because they do bluff you....just not at the spots you would expect. Also be sure to hide the nuts in every possible lines so you can call down these spots comfortable even with 2nd pair. 

Wait maybe they aren't bluffing....maybe they're value betting????",1608422459

Folds around to villain in MP, who raises to 1.20
Folds around to me, and I call. BB folds, we go heads up to the flop

Flop is 5T9 rainbow.

Villain bets 1.20, I call

Turn is 4d.

Villain bets 5.60, I call

River is an 8d, giving me 3 of a kind.

Villain bets 12.60. I raise 28.60. Villain jams and I call the rest of my stack which is about 30

I am dealt AJc in late position.

Villain UTG limps, I raise 1.60.

Folds around to villain who calls.

Flop is TJ8 rainbow.

Villain checks, I bet 2.20. Villain calls.

Turn is Ad, giving me 2 pair.

Villain checks to me, and I jam. It may have been tilt that led me to shove here when I would usually just continue as usual in this spot.

Villain snap calls and turns KQ with the straight.

River of course bricks and I lose my stack for the second time in 10 hands.

The fields are super soft, either nits or complete sinks stacking off with top pair. What strategies should I implement to start crushing? Play tight? Only play premiums? Bluffing often does not work. How should I play draws?

This is a fairly good card for me. I bet around half pot for thin value and get raised. This raise really confuses me so I think about what hands villain could have that raise me here. 97 that rivered the straight and....what else? Literally nothing. All of villain's value range would be betting or raising previous streets, why suddenly raise the river? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't think of any value hands Villain would be betting like this (besides a very specific river straight), but I can't think of any bluffs either so I fold.

UTG raises to 3 BB, CO calls 3 BB, BTN calls 3 BB, SB calls 2.6 BB, **Hero calls 2 BB**

This was a really tough spot with pocket 8s. On one hand, all these juicy callers that I would love to squeeze value out of. On the other hand, 8s are a middling pocket pair so there is a high chance the board is full of overcards and I'm forced to fold. With pocket 9s I would probably 3-bet more often than I flat, but it's a bit of a dicey decision with 8s. Do I 3-bet here? Do I flat?

I get probably the best flop I can hope for and manage to screw it up. I check first in case anyone has any flushes they'll shove, and one guy decides to bet. I check raise. Was that the correct decision, or should I have just flatted here?

I open fairly early and get 3 bet by the SB. This gives me pause, even with a hand as strong as AJc. Obviously I shouldn't be folding here, but there is a high chance villain has a strong pair or has my AJ dominated by AQ, AK type hands.   


Flop (21 BB, 2 players):  
 Ks6c2d  
SB bets 6.6 BB, **Hero calls 6.6 BB**

The flop is very very dry, and AK obviously hit a home run here. I debate whether to call or fold here, but the bet is pretty small. Should I always be folding everything less than AK/Strong equity underpairs?   


Turn (34.2 BB, 2 players):  
 Kc  
SB checks, **Hero bets 14 BB**, SB calls 14 BB

The turn is Kc and vilain checks. If I'm going to bluff them off of whatever small pair they have, now is the time. I go big for around half pot, but it apparently wasn't big enough as a I get snap called.   


River (62.2 BB, 2 players):  
 9c  
SB bets 14 BB, ***fold***

The river is a brick, and I screwed up my only chance to take down the pot. Villain is leading here which is saying 1 of 2 things. I have an underpair but don't want to call an aggressively large bet. Or 2, I have the king and I'm inviting a bluff raise. I screwed up my only bluff oppurtunity, if I was gonna get villain to fold their underpair the turn was the time to do it. Even if I shoved all in here, I'm pretty sure villain would call with JJ, QQ, TT type hands. The only hands I am getting to fold here would be very small pocket pairs, but they probably would fold to the turn bet. I take the loss and fold. Was the river bluff the right play, or should I have gone larger/checked back?

I bet because top pair and pretty small because there aren't going to be a lot of straight draws here. I get raised which puts me on pause. How often is villain going to be raising me here with a flopped set vs bluffing with a flush draw? I decided to call.

Now villain fires big again on the river. If I'm going to find a fold, the river is where I do it. What hands would be bet like this? Bluffs obviously. All of Villain's flush draw bluffs have made it, and his sets have a full house now (not that it matters I was dominated either way). Villain will value bet some of their stronger Jacks like this, like their 2 pairs and AJ, KJ, QJ type hands. But it is clear at this point that villain is not bluffing.

I’m UTG (1200 stack) and have AA. I open to 35 and a woman in middle position (1600-1700 stack) raises to 100.

This woman has yet to re-raise and is an older woman who claimed earlier in the night she hasn’t played in awhile. She essentially has a TAG playing style. Right away I’m putting her on a premium JJ-KK type of hand. 

It folds to me and I’m trying to figure out the proper raise size and in my head 3-betting to 300 sounds like the play. I grab 4 greens and accidentally grab 3 blacks as well and raise to 400....

She doesn’t tank long and ends up folding the hand. And I feel like I pretty much had AA written on my forehead. Afterwards I was thinking that I should have just announced “Raise, 300 total”. But I never announce my raises and I feel doing that would have also showed a ton of strength.

I just wanted to ask everyone’s opinion on the proper raise size here and your thoughts as well on announcing raise amounts and how much that portrays strength.

Moreover, what exactly does it mean to be outdated? For example, reading either Super System does feel like it was written at a time where 3-bets were non-existent as well as bluffing ranges.

The Theory of Poker still feels relevant since it introduces global concepts.  
The Little Green Book, doesn't feel outdated to me, but it now feels like basic strategies you can now find for free at poker training websites' basic lessons section.  
I actually like Every Hand Revealed, but well... Gus Hansen's style didn't age well in the long run for him.

(Fishing emoji),poker,"I’ve been playing poker for some years, I’ve just recently started playing it online from cash (more than half a year ago). I see sometimes players call other players “fish”. As I understand it is just another word to say “noob”. Now I have a question about the fishing emoji or the term “fishing”. I have always thought that this emoji and term means that some players are just looking for a bait and tries to “steal cash” from other players, mostly “fish”. But all that I found on the internet (didnt put in much work though), that these terms are the same. So maybe somebody has an opinion about this? Also, isn’t the term “fish” just a word from some pissed cunt in many cases and has nothing to do with the skills? Like for example, players  calling others noobs if they kill/getting killed. I do agree that I am not a very good player, but on the other hand, I study my games, read books about poker, watch the videos n shit and I think that I have at least a minimum understanding of a poker game. Today somebody called me lucky fish (im not offended lol, but I want to know the reason). I had pocket 66, the other player had pocket 10 10. I dont remember the flop, just one J card, but there were no 10’s or 6’s. I hit three of a kind on a turn and raised some chips, the guy went all in and he lost. Then he called me a lucky fish. Is it because I moved to far with 6’s? Cuz I felt that the other dude is suspicious and thought about the possibility of him having a pocket pair, but idk, maybe there are some things I dont see?

When he checks back the turn this thought gets even more in my head
That‘s why I decide to shove the river, pot was ~8$ and I shoved ~9,2$

6932,Folding AK Preflop in Cash Games?,poker,"I know it sounds crazy, and I know I've never seen anyone do it (unless there is multi-way all-in) but hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

Of the times I've got AK in preflop, half the time I'm up against either AA or KK, the other half I'm up against QQ or AK, it's not been a profitable play for me by any stretch currently.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like, in the smaller stakes at least, people only ever go all-in pre flop with either AA, KK, QQ or AK, against AA you have a 10-15% chance to win, KK you have 30ish% and against QQ you have around 43-47% chance. Against the best case scenario, QQ, AK is an underdog.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stumped as to why I see all of the pro's calling all-ins with AK - I've never called an all in with it preflop and been ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully my logic makes sense and someone can explain why my logic's wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Possibly I'm playing it wrong, and they should be jammed out of position, and just call a 3/4bet in position? But then what if villain 4bet jams to my 3bet?

6933,Avoid overcalling in sessions when you dont hit anything,poker,"Hi,

First, Ill try to give some context. I am a new player starting from the bottom. I have currently played 120k hands in threeish months and at hand #90k stepped up to NL5 and really love the game. Playing it, studying it, etc. I give so much credit to the mindset part of the game, so I always try to come here asking for help to more experienced players in this regard.

I have recently realized one of my biggest flaws in the game is that, those sessions when in the first 500 or 1000 hands I dont hit any flop, or only get marginal hands and my opponents have better, meaning I lose slowly but steady, I start to think I might be playing too nitty, so I start overcalling too many marginal hands, and thus, losing obviously because you guys know how micros are, bluffs in the river are not a thing.

I believe these sessions could mean easily 20%-33% of my losses. Does this happen to any of you? How do you combat it?

UTG (UTG): 103 BB  
MP (MP): 223.2 BB  
CO (CO): 107 BB  
BTN (BTN): 249 BB

**Hero posts SB 0.4 BB**, BB posts BB 1 BB

**Dealt to Hero:**  
KcQs

*fold*, MP limps for 1 BB, CO raises to 3 BB, *fold*, **Hero raises to 9 BB**, *fold*, MP calls 8 BB, CO calls 6 BB

This is a standard raise, although in hindsight I should have raised a little higher to discourage MP from calling. 

Flop (27 BB, 3 players):  
QcJd8h  
**Hero checks**, MP bets 27 BB, CO folds, **Hero calls**

If the flop was monotone I would obviously fold. If the flop had a flush draw I would feel a lot better about calling. I go through all the hands he could possibly be betting this big with. Overpairs, top set, and AQ, AK are unlikely. T9 suited, JJ(sometimes), 88, and QJ are all of his nutted hands he will be betting big with. He will also bet big with hands like KT, Q9 and QT suited. His range is extremely nutted and I'm very rarely going to be good here. I'm in a real tough spot here. If I call he's big stacked and I'm almost certain he will fire off another pot sized bet on the turn with all his hands. But folding KQ on the flop doesn't seem right either.....because what can I call with then? Do I have to change my mindset because this is a 3-way pot?  Do I have to be okay with folding everything less than the nuts sometimes? How often can I be calling here, and with what hands?

Turn (77.2 BB, 2 players):  
6c

**Hero checks**, MP bets 77.2 BB, **Hero calls**

The flop situation doesn't change at all, his hand is as good as it was before.  As expected he pots again on the turn. I don't like making this call at all but I basically forced myself into this situation by tank-calling the flop. Call/Folding wouldn't make sense because the flop situation hasn't changed at all. He's going to pot again with every hand he pot the flop with. He's going to bet big with whatever draws he has hoping to force a fold. He will also bet big with all his sets/2 pair/straights hoping to get another call. This is when I started to believe that my flop call was a mistake. I should have only called with sets+ that would be comfortable going all in on the flop or turn. 

River (231.6 BB, 2 players):  
9s

In the end he had KT offsuit and hit the 9 on the river. But that isn't important. I find myself in these spots a lot where I have a bluff catcher type hand vs an extremely strong range. Sure this time it turned out I hit the bottom of his range, but if I'm always going to go all in on the turn isn't this really bad for me? Should I just be folding the majority of my hands in these spots no matter how pretty they look? Am I too sticky? Is folding top pair on the flop sometimes ALWAYS the right move?",1607982645

6959,Return of Poker After Dark,poker,"Without any ""spoilers"" (I mean who cares, really, there was one big hand between Lamb and Justin Young that bears analysis) what were the impressions on the return of the show?

While it was good to see the familiar settings of the Aria poker room and watch well-produced live poker without masks and barriers obstructing the view, I am not a fan of the way PokerGo is presenting the show. By airing it in 45 minute weekly segments, they are giving us more of the old-style poker show with lots of editing, little downtime. 

Personally, I much prefer firing up the long, 5 hour plus streams in the background, because you get to see much more of the ebb and flow and a better sense of the player personalities. I suspect they adopted this model for the sake of retaining maximum customers-instead of letting us binge it like Netflix, they want to milk it like its ""The Mandalorian."" I suspect the return of High Stakes Poker will feel much the same, although I am excited they actually brought Kaplan and Benza back to the booth.

Thoughts on the gameplay? Was the Young v. Lamb hand a total cooler, could one find the fold on the river? Why is a guy 3-betting 67 clubs, calling a 4bet and floating a k42 flop, and then in the next hand calling a 3-bet with pocket jacks? How do people actually misread the board when they call 10k bets on the turn? Will Antonio shake his ""pro-fish"" status this season?",1607961649

6973,"Thoughts on ""GTO""?",poker,"I honestly feel kind of dreadful towards about everybody becoming more skilled in poker. Don't get me wrong, going to my local $1/$2  still brings in a nice amount. But occasionally I see some crushers who seem to know how to play balanced way more than me, yet also know how to exploit tendencies much better than me. If I see this live 1/2 crusher i honestly just move tables. Overall it's not a big deal, i can still just avoid hands with them if I can't move but this has got me thinking. If everybody just plays close to perfectly balanced poker at high stakes, this means at that point poker is just gambling right? If everyone has some semblance of balanced gameplay, you now have no real input on the outcome of the game. Now you're just trying to memorize patterns and solver outputs. Almost like chess right? except poker has variance in its core gameplay. 

What are your guys' thoughts on this? To sum it up, I think most people don't care enough to learn poker for this to be an issue but the idea of everybody at my table being a well balanced player is scary.",1607944763

The problem is, there isn't much theory literature around multipot dynamics  because they all focus on heads up.

Often I get to the flop and I have some sort of middle pair. For example, KJ on QJ7 or TT on KJ6. Something like that. I'm never sure whether to bet or check.

I look at piosolver and it says to do a mixture of betting and checking. When you have a suited hand and have a backdoor flush draw, it says to bet most of the time. When you don't have any sort of backdoor draw, it says to check most of the time.

I'm not sure really. I feel like it gives away the strength of my hand most of the time. I end up check-calling once and then giving up if they bet again. Or if I bet, I bet once and then check the turn if I'm called. I feel like this is not the best way to play these middle pairs.

I’ve been getting really into online poker recently, and playing quite a bit. I generally do well, and usually end up making money though the amounts are pretty small. However, when I play with friends, I almost always do worse compared to my performance online. None of them are well-versed I poker, outside of when we play together. 

As for me, I’ve worked my way through Harrington on Hold’em and understand pretty basic strategy for Texas hold’em (though obviously I’m a mere beginner and have much to learn.) 

So my question is, why do I often lose to my friends who generally don’t know as much about the game, and in my opinion often make bad judgments when it comes to playing hands? Am I not capitalizing on their habits properly? Am I lacking fundamentals?

Flop is 6h9hJh. 

I bet $30. He raises to $75, I call. I call because I felt like he'll take the lead betting and that's fine with me. He could have a set and makes house 30% of the time or he could have K flush he feels is good. Either way, we will likely stack in on the turn when he bets and I shove. 

Turn is 9d. 

Board pairs and that makes me a bit bothered but I felt like he could still be sitting on K flush and how often does someone raise-flat pre then raise on mono flop. He jams for $180 and I find the call. He had 69o.

I've spent the past few days using free games against bots to just run through as many scenarios as possible. My plan has been to run through a lot of iterations of different scenarios so I get a sense of how each one can play out. Bots let me do this much faster and with no actual financial cost compared to 0.01/0.02 cash games.    


It's helped me getting a more instinctive sense of how position is affecting me and think a few steps ahead but I'm wondering if it encourage some bad habits since these bots aren't necessarily going to respond in the same way humans would.   


What are your thoughts on using bots to train at this early stage?

I just threw $20 in and started playing 0.1/0.2 cash games to practice. I want to practice my statistics and solidify a strategy, but play for fun too. I lost my BI at this 9 seated table by going all in, and I am not sure if I made the best move or mathematically if its the best as well.

I am in the SB with AKs, UTG 1 and 3 limp, button raises 2BB. I raise to 3BB. Everyone folds but BB and button. Flop comes Th Kh Jc. i bet 3/4 pot (pot is .22 i bet .16). At this point I am only worried about flush draw, so I try to make the bet big enough to get someone out whos waiting on a draw. Someone could also have AQ to flop a straight but I assume those odds are so low. So I have the overcard pair with highest kicker at the moment. Button calls my .16. River is 5s. I had a 1/2 pot bet to get some value if hes chasing a flush draw, or just steal the 27BB pot if he didnt hit. He goes all in, I am thinking maybe he has a jack or king with lower kicker so I call. River is 4s. He ended up having 2 pair, K and T. 

Did I make the right moves? How can I calculate odds or realize odds that he would flop a 2 pair that would beat out my AK one pair? How could I do better in the moment?",1607804620

*fold*, MP raises to 2.4 BB, CO calls 2.4 BB, BTN calls 2.4 BB, **Hero raises to 15 BB**, *fold*, *fold*, CO calls 12.6 BB, BTN calls 12.6 BB

The reason I really like this move is because it caps my opponent's ranges. If I get shoved on I fold because they have aces and kings solely. If they call, I have this INSANE range advantage because they'll limp in with suited connecter garbage they don't have the discipline to fold and I can probably take it down right there when they miss the flop (they could POSSIBLY call with AK but most likely they would shove with that too).

Flop (48.4 BB, 3 players):

**Hero bets 14 BB**, CO calls 14 BB, BTN raises to 57.4 BB and is all-in, **Hero raises to 144.8 BB**, CO raises to 200.2 BB and is all-in, **Hero calls 55.4 BB**

This is almost a dream flop for me. All the suited connecter garbage they limped in with will probably hit this board hard, and because their ranges are capped I don't have to worry about a set of kings that much (fairly less likely). I want to stack hands like KT and K9 and AK and I want to build this pot fast. I start with a small poke planning on sizing it up on the turn if a scary card doesn't come. When the small stack shoves I raise to fold out the big stack and get a clean pot in case he also has spades in his hand. If he has an AK hand I highly doubt he will be folding here so I'm hoping to stack him too. You could argue that the raise is too big, or largely unnecessary. Again I'm used to smaller stacked poker where you get it in early when you hit a big hand.

The small stack has KT but the big stack has a QJ offsuit with a flopped straight. I'm kicking myself for not cashing out earlier, say gg, and then leave the table.

So here I thought I basically had the nuts. Sure, they could possibly have pocket kings but they would mostly be shoving preflop and I crush pocket aces. Flush draws are very possible so the only thing I'm worried about is potentially scary turn and river cards. When around 100BB I want to be re-raising here a lot to get value from AK, KQ, KJ type hands that are too stubborn to fold. The thing is, I'm big stacked now. Should I really be shoveling in money with anything other than the stone cold nuts? Is this only a cooler situation when I have KK? Should I be more passive with TT in case he limped in with KK? Or do I just gotta shove and say ""gg"" when he has the nuts?",1607793414
7065,Duhamel-is he a pariah or a martyr?,poker,"I'm curious what the general perception of the poker playing community is regarding the 2010 Main Event champ's stance in his tax case against the Canadian government. For those who aren't aware, they are coming after him for more money from the ME win, and he is going to argue that winning a poker involves a good degree of luck (duh), although there is quite a bit of nuance in the argument. The hand from the tournament that everyone remembers of course was his pocket Jacks running down Matt Affleck's pocket Aces, and that hand perfectly encapsulates his argument. For more background, here is the Cardplayer write-up:

[https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/25438-world-series-of-poker-main-event-champ-argues-poker-is-game-of-chance-to-avoid-tax-payment](https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/25438-world-series-of-poker-main-event-champ-argues-poker-is-game-of-chance-to-avoid-tax-payment)

Is this blasphemy to make this argument in open court? To some this may be sacrosanct to argue, but from another perspective, Duhamel is defending all his fellow Canadian players as well. If the Canadian government prevails in is argument, they will set a precedent that allows them to go after other players who have won. It is already well known that Canadian national pros largely avoid the tournament circuit due to their tax policies, so for Duhamel to take this position, some might even say he is a crusader for justice!",1607793238

This is an amazing flop for me. the board is small, the board is connected, so I'm going to get calls from a lot of the trash people limped in with even if I bet big. My biggest worry here is that someone  could have easily limped in with a 4. I figure I'll deal with it later and slow down my betting if the board gets scary.

For some reason it's the Ace of diamonds that gets me to pause and think about how good my hand really is (and not the scary turn card). I decide to check call any reasonable bet to induce any overcard bluffs (overcard bluffs that would normally be raising preflop. Again, I played really stupidly this hand)

Now I understand my turn barrel and river check-call were probably pretty bad. What I'm asking is what I should mostly be doing in these spots when my hand basically becomes a bluff catcher. Do I turn passive and open myself up to aggressive raises? Do I maintain the aggression even when my opponent shows signs of strength? My biggest leak right now is deciding what hands I should call and fold with at showdown. Should I err on the side of caution and fold most of my bluff catchers? Should I flip a coin every time I get in a situation like this? How do I decide whether to call or fold? Of course you can say ""fold bluff catchers most of the time"" but I've realized people bluff more often than you would expect, and get really aggressive with weak bluff catchers (like underpairs and weak top pair).",1607788466

Fast forward to a hand where I raise, get a caller, then get three-bet. Both me and the cold caller flat, and we go three ways to the flop.

Actions checks through on the flop. Checks to me on the turn, and I’m last to act. The board was wet and had lots of potential draws. I was considering turning my hand into a bluff, and was just thinking about sizing and ranges.

After about a minute, another player at the table starts bitching about how long I’m taking. “You can check or bet. Why you thinking for so long? Etc.” At that point, the cold caller in the hand starts chiming in and bitching about it to. I just say, “It’s a big pot. I want to think about things.” 

They keep bitching, and finally the three-bettor says, “Dealer, you gonna handle this? I think he has a right to take his time.”

Dealer replies, “Anyone has a right to call the clock.” I say fuck it and check the turn. River bricks, and it checks to me again. I start thinking about whether or not I’m getting a bluff through, and after thirty seconds, the cold caller calls the clock on me. I just say, “Are you serious?” and check. 

So we’re at showdown, and the guy who called the clock is first to act. The three-bettor says, “You know all the rules; you have to show first.” He refuses. So I call the clock on him.

Fast forward a few hands later, that guy has a tough decision on the river. After about a minute, I say, “Who we waiting on? This is taking forever.” The dude gets pissed and says I’m being ridiculous, and then we argue for another minute or so.

TT-QQ: 3 bet for a squeeze. I hate to get 4 bet but if I do I can pretty easily fold TT but QQ would be a shitty spot. At the same time, dont wanna play multiway with these hands really.
KK+: 3 bet for value

Second Example:
UTG opens for 3x and MP/CO 3 bets to 9x:

22-77: Fold
88-99: ?????? (Mix of flat call squeeze? Seems like fold as well idek)
TT-JJ: Mostly 4 bet or fold I assume bc multiway is shit and I worry about UTG 4 bet. Also Squeeze is nice dead money
QQ: This one idk ig i am strong enough to flat but multiway sucks and I dont close action. Seems too strong to 4 bet bluff at the same time.

KK+: 4 Bet


Any advice on these spots would be appreciated. Ik theres no one answer and it depends on a lot of factors but is my logic sound at least?",1607732707

7103,Game Selection Advice,poker,"Hi guys, this is my first Reddit post and I thought I would talk about something very important in poker. I think I saw Marle talking about this on Twitter the other day, but game selection is so important that I wanted to discuss it here. I want to firstly say that this is not meant as a brag and if it comes across that way then I’m sorry.  

Ok here we go:

As poker players, I think it is very easy for our egos to blind us in to thinking we’re better than we are, ie blaming losing on variance and attributing large wins to skill. However, this thinking in the long run is just losing you and I money. I think that it’s so important to be honest to yourself about your skill level because there’s absolutely no shame in that. 

For myself, I generally played tournaments and cash games online on Party-poker or 888 and I always seemed to be running around break even or losing money. I would always try to move up in stakes when I was losing to make up for smaller losses and would often end up with $0 in my account. 

Until about 9 months ago, I never really made much money because I was trying to play against people who were better than I was and my ego got in the way. Since then however, I’ve been playing in a home game on Pokerrr 2 and am up around $17,000 at $0.5/$1. I know this might be met with scepticism, but I just wanted to use this as an example of how vital game selection is. Don’t let any “GTO Reg” make you feel bad about playing low stakes if you’re profitable, because you don’t need to be able to beat Phil Ivey to make money at poker, you just need to be better than the people you are playing against.",1607725150

Excuse the pitifully small 3-bet, I wasn't paying attention and thought I was MP 3-betting UTG open.  In hindsight a bigger 3-bet would have made this hand a lot easier to play and the turn call could be a lot more justifiable.

This turn card is terrible for me and I REALLY want to fold. If the bet was any bigger it would be an instafold but 1/3 pot is just.......I'm getting too good odds to fold here unless he's never betting with AK/Flush draws and ONLY betting with overpairs and full houses. Should I always be folding my weak overpairs here? Sure my hand is nothing but a weak bluff catcher but I'm getting odds to call and he isn't always going to have me crushed. On the other hand, he check raised the flop which shows enormous strength. I thought about this for a LONG time before reluctantly deciding to call and hope the flush doesn't complete or an overcard doesn't hit the board. Should I always fold here because he can easily bluff the river? 

&amp;#x200B;

 River (135.2 BB, 2 players):

I am hating my life right now because I have to fold to pretty much any river bet now. Most of his bluffs made it so his range is pure value now. I check and get ready to fold. 

&amp;#x200B;

He shows up on the river with pocket 5s. I knew I was probably going to lose the pot but I didn't think I would lose like this. I would understand if he was semi-bluffing with KhQh or AK, or thin value betting with a strong overpair, or somehow hit the full house with a suited connecter, even semi bluffing with a weak flush draw would make sense but 55???? Seriously???? betting 1/3 pot on a double paired board with a flush draw and literally having 2 outs that aren't even clean??? I was so ready to consider my call a massive leak but if they're gonna be betting with 55 I'm certain I cannot be folding pocket 10s here. Thoughts?",1607708542

I am a teacher so I play in streaks during my breaks and one day on the weekends. I am not interested in playing anymore regularly when I work because I am also a varsity football coach and my son is an athlete in the spring. 

All of that being said when I play I would like to win. I hadn’t played on a few years because where I lived there were no card rooms. Before that I had played for a year and was up about 5,000 before I moved. Where I live now there is a card room about an hour away so I started playing again at the end October. For two weeks I was up $600. Then I played in November and was up like $2500 for the month.

Then came the downswing (which I know it part of it). Basically I dropped 1,500 straight, won $300 and then lost $500 more. It’s the worst stark downward I have had. I will like to blame it on variance and that’s part of it but I’ve played terrible and made some unreasonable calls and bluffs both and brought it on myself.

I had plans this year to travel full time and hit up a lot of the Poker Series across the US.  In February I listed my house, rental properties, and began selling most of my stuff (cars, tools, etc).  I was primed to start my Poker Tour at the end of May and planned to end it July 2021 at the WSOP main event.  This tour was not all about poker but poker was the driving force.

Covid happened and all my plans fell through.  I still sold my things (house, rentals, cars, tools, etc) but  not sure what to plan for next year.

What are your outlook on next year poker tournament scene with how things are looking now?  Will it get back into motion by June?  Tournaments get a lot of casual players and I am afraid a year away will greatly change the tournament scene.  I know no one knows the future but some here may have more information that they can shed light on future predictions.

Anyone here who travels full time for the Poker Tournaments have any advice and ""what not to do"" and ""wish I had known"" feedback on this lifestyle.  I have plans on buying an RV (for the year plus all future road trips).",1607644917

last 8 people, next payout 8-10k. There were 2 massive chip leaders with about 30bb each, the rest had between 2 and 10 BB. It folds to the SB (30bb), he pushes all in against the other big stack in the BB. He wakes up with AA and snap calls. SB busts.

**Dealt to Hero:**  
 10c10s

*fold*, MP raises to 3 BB, CO calls 3 BB, **Hero raises to 12 BB**, *fold*, *fold*, MP calls 9 BB, *fold*

I raise to 12BB to discourage callers. Should I be raising bigger here or is this sizing alright?   


Flop (28.4 BB, 2 players):  
 9c8h3s  
MP checks, **Hero bets 13.6 BB**, MP calls 13.6 BB

I am ahead of the vast majority of villains range besides overpairs that beat mine. I wanna bet big and get value from his AK, AQ, AJ type overcards that are too stubborn to fold, and some of his small pocket pairs that want to see showdown.   


Turn (55.6 BB, 2 players):  
 6h  
MP checks, **Hero bets 39.8 BB**, MP calls 39.8 BB

I fire big again, but a bit bigger because the flush draw and potential straight draw he could have. If he's going to outdraw me I'm not going to make it cheap.   


River (135.2 BB, 2 players):  
 8s  
MP checks, **Hero bets 79.2 BB and is all-in**, MP calls 79.2 BB

The river is pretty much a blank. If he flopped a set he was ahead of me the entire time. The question here only is, is he going to call with hands that my hand beats or would a smaller bet accomplish the same thing but better? 

Villain tanked a while before calling with pocket jacks, which confused me more than anything. I would think villain would snap call with worse hands, but if he's tanking with pocket jacks that means my hand is more of a bluff than anything. Am I value betting too thin or too big here?

7205,UPDATE: r/poker NLHE tournament,poker,"2 days ago I posted this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/k9ggir/is_it_possible_to_have_an_rpoker_nlhe_tournament/ asking if people in this subreddit would be down for a r/poker NLHE tourney. It got tons of interest! So because of that I thought I'd make an updated post so we can try and move things along. If any mods see this and want to make a pinned thread feel free. 

So pretty much our options here are a free tourney or a cash tourney, or both if some people prefer one over the other. u/AmericasCardroomRep said they would be able to host a tourney, so that would allow people from the US to join which is 100% a must (I'm from Canada myself but would like to include everyone, or else whats the point?). I haven't played on ACR, can Canadians and people outside the US play on there? https://www.americascardroom.eu/online-poker-promotions/private-online-poker-tournament/ Here is the ACR link their rep sent me.

If ACR doesn't work, /u/Privatepoker said we could use their site www.runpokertournaments.com. I've never used this site before so if anyone else has and has some reviews please let me know. 

/u/Krete77 said he would also host it. So we have plenty of options. IMO ACR should be first to be considered, but if we can't get everyone on there then we should look for another route. We want to include as many countries as possible so everyone can play! 

Other than figuring out where to play, there is some other details we need to iron out. Please give me any advice or ideas you have, I want to hear from everyone and will try to include everyone's ideas. I want this to be a community thing where everyone has a say. Some things we need to consider:

* What type of tourny do you guys like? (Turbo, Bounty, etc) https://linkto.run/p/GN2MFUGL 
* If cash tourny: Buy-in? $10? $20? How many re-buys. allowed? Please keep in mind we want everyone to be able to play so we don't want the buyin too high as people have different budgets. https://linkto.run/p/O5JTJYK7
* What day/weekend should it be scheduled for and what time? https://linkto.run/p/WN8ZNJDD
* 6max? Full-ring? What do you guys prefer? https://linkto.run/p/131WU25F

I have created some polls for you guys to vote. If an option you like isn't included please just comment on what you'd like to see. I just picked the first basic dates/buyins etc I could think of. 

That's pretty much it for now. If there's anything I missed or something you want included please post it in the comments. I do not want to be the only one in control of this. I'd like everyone's opinion so that everyone is satisfied and has a good time. 

Also, i'd like to get flairs made for the final table or something so the winners have some extra incentive and the ability to flex their win/final table xD

Dbshash (UTG) wins $7.79

In this spot, I feel like it's too exploitable to be folding ever, and I really just put him on an over pair or maybe a set at best. On the turn in my head I was like 'well I'm losing to T9 and chopping with 9x but UTG shouldn't have opened with those hands' and obviously I ran into it. Is this the correct way to think about these occurrences, just kinda laugh it and move on, or do you find a fold here somehow when he bombs the river to 3.5 my pot sized bet?",1607560221

Turn comes a 5. He bets almost pot and I call.

Villain plays like an absolute maniac. Have to call with QQ here? esp. with flush draws missing?

Same maniac from hand 2. I had the pot odds for KK. My flop bet was to price out flush draws and weak aces.

&amp;#x200B;

Hand 4:[https://i.imgur.com/C3BEstE.png](https://i.imgur.com/C3BEstE.png)

Villain has gone AIPF with weaker in the same session. Is JJ a call here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Hand 5:[https://i.imgur.com/8k8Wa3u.png](https://i.imgur.com/8k8Wa3u.png)

Ran this one in flopzilla. I should have 49.3% equity against his range. tried to price out his flush draw but ran into AJ. Anyway to avoid?

Hand 7:[https://i.imgur.com/9SwFQXE.png](https://i.imgur.com/9SwFQXE.png)

JJ vs AA AIPF. Is this how I should play JJ pf?

Example: 4-8 Omaha with 3 players left on the turn

2 players (A and B) are in for $16 on the turn. Player C raises to $24, player A re-raises to $32, now player B goes all in for $22

Is it as simple as putting B’s $22 into the main pot and creating a side pot for players A &amp; C??

Also, what happens in the same scenario but the all in is less than half the bet? 

Player A bets $8, and Player B goes all in for $3. 
What are player C’s options? What does “completing the bet” actually look like, and what can happen subsequently? 

I know it’s easier to explain hands on. Hoping someone can help me understand

I raise preflop for this reason and a couple of players call, I called on a player who raised, Flop gave me a straight draw so I call a man who bet quite a lot expecting h to have a K-10 or that type of range, the turn card comes and I hit the straight and I was sure the other guy probably hit the straight too. So I was ready to double up, he goes all-in with a double pair I call I am winning but another J hit the river and he got a full house with the river card and won :( This one hurt so bad that honestly don't even wanna play anymore. I have had many aces, KK and other stupid bad beats and you know I don't really mind it that much as I tend to avoid coinflips and it happens but this one was soul-crushing.

I know that even with my current bankroll it's about 10 buy ins which is one weekend away from going busto. Should I add a few thousand more into my bankroll and play more comfortably?

Whether your a live player or a online player,  We have all spend a lot more time playing online.

Many live players have set up groups for their clubs. Which has brought more players together that were not constant attendants of the weekly game. Now you can play with people that you would not see for months at a time. Which is bring more players to together. 

Everyone seem to want a game at the moment. We also have the Polg vs Negreanu battle going which is receiving massive viewing and  discussion from both sides of the game.

As restrictions are lifted are we going to see a peak in players in live and home game play?

For many of us that have been playing since the early 2000s when poker seemed to turn up everywhere, you went from the office to your local pub.

With the greats of the game playing high stakes cash again on tv and the rise of the vlogger it seems that poker is know for everyone. 

We can all have a say know which is great for the game. As poker is starting to get the exposure that it deserves again it seems that the past  poker crash in the usa is starting to fade into the past memory. 

As new players emerge into the scene poker is once again seeping into the minds of the masses.

The game of poker is constantly changing, causing it to split into online and live. There is  place for both in the world of poker, one thing i will say is that i feel poker is on the up and when normality resumes we shall see a raise in live play from both old and new players.

Poker is and always will be a game that brings us to together through the good and times.

Wasn't really sure about this hand honestly, the utg calling range for a 3bet versus sb is quite tight and I don't see 7's being there so his pot bet seems odd...
I have a feeling he hit a set of 9's on the river but still, pot betting there is a little overplaying when there's 4 to a straight. You guys got any thoughts?",1607472462

TL:DR - I run a home game . I'm filling my 2 table setup very quickly - and could fill a 3rd.  Instead of texting the 200+ People on my list - I want an online reservation system.  I can't find one and need help

Longer version:

So I've been running a home game for about 1.5-2 years now.  I started with 1 table and at 2 tables.  I run tournaments and 1/2 NLH.  The focus for this post is really on the tournament.  I feel like it's becoming a management nightmare sending out my text updates for the game.  I send the texts and within 5 minutes, i'm completely full and having to turn people away.  The main issue with sending the texts is that the app I'm using (Reach) goes down the list alphabetically and doesn't just do a blast all at once.  I then confirm people based on the order that they reply back.  

Ultimately I realize this isn't fair as people who's name start with 'S' are at a disadvantage for people who's name starts with 'A'.   So I'm trying to come up with a reservation system that I can either host or host on an aaS cloud offering.  

This is a great problem for me to have and i'm also going to be expanding to a 3rd tournament table at some point (not really wanting to do that right now due to COVID).  But I do want to get ahead of this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this has to have been solved before...I just can't find a solid answer.  Any help is appreciated.",1607445751

Table Info: Version: 1, Type: MVS, Stakes: $0.02-$0.05, Table: 00000000-0

Seat 1: Small Blind ($5.17 in chips)

Seat 2: Big Blind ($5.99 in chips)

Seat 3: UTG ($5.46 in chips)

Seat 4: UTG+1 ($5 in chips)

Seat 5: UTG+2 ($5.26 in chips)

Seat 6: Dealer \[ME\] ($5.10 in chips)

Dealer \[ME\] : Set dealer \[6\]

\*\*\* HOLE CARDS \*\*\*

Dealer \[ME\] : Card dealt to a spot \[Ad Kh\]

UTG : Raises $0.15 to $0.15

UTG+1 : Folds

UTG+2 : Folds

Dealer \[ME\] : Raises $0.45 to $0.45

This is a standard 3-bet I believe. I'm not folding here ever and flatting would be kinda stupid.

Small Blind : Folds

Big Blind : Folds

UTG : Calls $0.30

I've noticed a weird tendency that people call rather than fold or 4-bet to my 3-bets. More on this later.

\*\*\* FLOP \*\*\* \[4h Kd 6s\]

UTG : Bets $0.35

Dealer \[ME\] : Calls $0.35

This flop is a slam dunk for me but I don't want to raise here and scare away hands like underpairs and suited broadways that would c-bet here. This is a board that my 3-bet range hits very often so if I check raise here it'll naturally be very value heavy, and I would fold out a lot of the TT, JJ type hands I want to keep betting.

\*\*\* TURN \*\*\* \[4h Kd 6s\] \[3d\]

UTG : Bets $0.55

Dealer \[ME\] : Calls $0.55

Now this is where the warning alarms start going off in my head. Why these weirdly small bets? Is my AK no good? If I check raise here, is he going to have anything but a flopped set? If he limped some hand like 5 7 offsuit he's drooling right now. I feel like villain could only have some straight draw or the stone cold nuts like a set or straight. Any other hand he had would be betting a lot bigger.

\*\*\* RIVER \*\*\* \[4h Kd 6s 3d\] \[8h\]

UTG : Bets $2

Dealer \[ME\] : All-in(raise) $3.75 to $3.75

Now this 8 deals the final blow to me. I think to myself, if he has the hand I think he has I am never good here. He has hit whatever straight/2 pair type low card hand he limped in with. I'm either facing some weirdly played underpair, pocket aces, or some set or straight. Villains range is extremely polarized so my hand is really nothing more than a bluff catcher. My instincts screamed at me to fold but then I told myself ""If I fold AK here I'm folding too often"". Sure I could just call this bet but it's so big I might as well shove if I'm going to call. Is that true? How often is he going to come to showdown with underpairs/KQ/KJ second best type hands?

UTG : Calls $1.75

He had 7h 5h and made a straight on the turn. My gut feeling was right.

Now this is a 3-bet pot and I'm not sure what my check raise frequencies on the flop and turn should be, but they can't be that high right? I'm beginning to think people are flatting 3-bets far wider than they should be. I had a similar hand to this pretty recently where someone flatted my AA 3 bet with 67 suited and hit their straight on the turn. Do I just chalk this up as a cooler, or should I be folding in these spots more often? Normally I don't give people odds to draw and check raise them when I can, but I thought this was a fairly dry board and my hand didn't need the protection.",1607431555

Over the pandemic I had become quite lazy, not really studying or playing any poker, so I decided to start up a stream to get some motivation going, and so far it's been pretty good. I stream with my cats, and give fairly active strategic commentary. I also do some study streams with no delay (check out the archives if you like), so if anyone new to poker and want to see how a somewhat more experienced (but lazy) player approaches studying with solvers especially in PLO, you might find something useful here.

7389,Hand Review with AKo,poker,"This is from Bovada 10NL

This is not a bad beat story or anything I just want some input on the hand and advice
About 100BB starting stacks multiway

UTG opens to .30
MP flats
Im on the button with AsKd

My first thought was I dont want to take AK multiway but offsuit against this action seemed like an easy flat. First question: If it was suited would it br a 3 bet?

Flop comes Ks4d6d

UTG bets .75 for 3/4 pot 
MP calls 
I call
Seems unnecessary to raise here though I dont like the draws. UTG shouldnt be c betting here much with nothing. Second Question: Is this sound logic or is another action better?

Turn comes Kh
UTG checks
MP checks
I bet a little under half pot.
I dont want draws to hit like diamonds, or if for some reason the EP players have a str8 draw but not too worried about that. Not sure what size to use. Think a bigger size works bc any king is going to call and going too small gives flushes a good price, but may also keep a hand like TT-QQ in, even though this is pretty irrelevant. Third question: Is a size closer to 2/3 more effective?

UTG check raises to 3x about and MP folds. Theres only about 1/2 PSB in my stack anymore and I end up jamming.

Looking back I realize most Kings in UTG range would continue barreling to protect from flushes. Besides maybe a KQdd or KJdd, but I block these, so realistically he doesnt have any Kings in his range as far as I can tell. This means he must have air or some boat (Again not trying to be results oriented, but with the Kd he cant be checking to make sure he doesnt get raised off his equity, so checks must be naked draws or boats). 

He ended up having 44 which made more sense but realistically can I fold here?
Especially with Kd he must be pretty nutted here especially with MP in between. This seems like a fold looming back, but would i be too exploitable folding here? Especially check raising multiway OOP. Not feeling bad for myself but a fold seems somewhat reasonable here based on action. All I beat is an overvalued K, which though is very reasonable at Microstakes, seems unlikely. Any input appreciated",1607389126

7404,"Ran into a tricky situation in online tournament, need your thoughts and opinions!",poker,"SCENARIO: 4th hand dealt at the first level of a 0.25 buy-in 90 player MTT on pokerstars, Hero has 1462 stack from original 1500 remaining, and is dealt [Td](Td) [Th](Th) in the Small blind. Blinds are 10/20, no antes in play. UTG and UTG+1 fold, Villain one raises 3x BB to 60, folds around to Villain 2 who 3-Bets just under 4x to 237. 

What is the best play in this situaton? I think calling is too risky here; we have THE shittest position in poker, it would be a cold-call and not a raise, so we'd be telling both opponents more or less our exact hand strength, BB could potentially wake up with a hand, and the original raiser can still go over the top of Villain two.

I think 5-betting or shipping it all-in is also too risky of a play, considering this is only the 4th hand of the tournament, no antes are in play, and this feels like a coin-flip situation at BEST. If we were closer to the bubble or if I had more chips to be won, could an argument be made for shipping it all-in?? How many blinds would you feel safe risking with this play?

I think folding is too nitty of a play here, but that is what I ended up doing in the end because I couldn't think of any positive situation for this scenario to play out. What are your thoughts and opinions regarding this?",1607378193

Background: I'm building a database and log parser from my online pandemic home games, using it to calculate stats. (Shoutout for u/donkhousepoker \-- fantastic site.)

My google-fu tells me that PFR only includes opening raises -- i.e. when the player first enters the pot. Anyone who, for example, limps AA UTG and then pounces with a 3- or 4-bet preflop will not have this action included in his PFR stats because the opening action was a call.

Granted, I would expect this situation to happen infrequently enough that probably just a rounding error in a database of thousands of hands, but I'm curious why this type of aggressive action would not be part of PFR? Shouldn't any raise preflop, even if it was preceded by a limp, be considered a Pre-Flop Raise?",1607362237
7417,Downswing mentality,poker,"I'm relatively new to playing poker, but I've taken it pretty seriously.  (Read a couple books, downloaded range charts, etc.)   However, after some very profitable sessions, I've hit a wall and gone on a downswing (nut flush losing to full house 3 sessions in a row) and I'm back down to my starting bankroll.  My last 1-3 session I was up a little bit when I got A-9d in middle position (360 effective) and opened up to 15, when the SB (tight player) 3bets to 50.  (300 effective)  Everyone else folds and I realize here he has JJ or better, given how he's been playing.  I decide to call because I know that he'll pay me off if I flop good equity, and I'm feeling the pressure to book a big win again.  Flop is 2d, 4d, and 5c.  He leads out for 70, which prompts me to think about my next move.  I don't want to call, cause I know he's value betting, so I'm leaning on folding or jamming, since the pot is already kinda large for 1-3.  Given my recent downswing going on, I'm anxious to book that big win again, and I feel like I have enough equity to call with the nut flush draw and gutshot straight draw.  This way I can put fold pressure on his JJ-KK and still have equity to beat his AA.  He tanks (which was a good sign for me) and eventually calls with AA.  Of course I brick out and get stacked and once again end the session with an L.  I'm afraid my downswing is effecting my mentality when I play, so I'm going to take a break to make sure I don't overthink situations and make bad decisions based on my recent play.

I have just under $12,000 in live tournament winnings ($11,374 if it had to be an exact figure), and after tournament buy-ins totaling $6000, I have a total net profit of $5,374, for a 47% ROI (Approximately 100 tournaments played, averaging $60 a tournament buy-in)

Since the beginning of October I have started playing online micro MTT's on Pokerstars (mainly the $0.25 45 player MTT and the $0.10 360 player Turbo MTT) and have compiled a small sample of tournament data in that time, and was wondering if I could get any kind of thought or critique/constructive criticism on how I am doing so far for my online tournament play. I purchased Poker Copilot and have a 21k hand sample obtained so far. Between these stats and what my Pokerprolabs player account information has provided me, here are my following stats and I would simply like to know if it possible to tell if I am playing well, or on a really good heater right now.

Pre-Flop Aggression: Everything is listed as good except Big blind as ""passive"" at 38%. ""Raise more, call less""

Positional Awareness: All listed as ""Good""

Blind Stealing: Attempt Rate: 44% (Good) BB won/100 hands from blind steal attempts: 65.10 BB won/overall: 11.87

Pocket Pairs: Everything listed has a positive BB won/100 hands with the exception of pocket 6's at -23.13 BB/100 (Notably, my AA and KK both have +1100BB /100, is this normal?)

Suited Connectors: AK and KQ suited have +324 and +214 respectively, everything else is basically canceling each other out. Would like to improve my JTs -75.33 BB/100 desperately.

7456,"pSA: GTO is not ""Nitty TAG Who Never Bluffs""",poker,"After seeing yet another comment about how GTO players ""don't get action"" or that ""their style is boring"", I thought I would give this PSA on equilibrium play.

""GTO"" isn't nutpeddling, it's playing a literally game-theory optimal style, meaning that no matter what adjustments your opponents make to your strategy, they cannot play a higher EV strategy than you. Yes, this doesn't mean you're maximizing EV versus suboptimal players. No one is actually playing ""game theory optimal"" without RTA. They just have strategies informed by solvers that output Game Theory Optimal solutions.

The style of gameplay is far from ""never bluff"" or being a passive player, in fact, it's predicated on finding ways to put in a lot of money into the pot when you, on average, have stronger hands than your opponents. Bluffs are used to take make your opponent indifferent to your bets, or forcing them to overfold their equity in many spots due to being out of position/having a weaker ""range"" of hands. 

It's rare to see the solid $5/$10 live grinder playing in a GTO/""unexploitable"" style, since in a player pool where you can bet large with good hands and get called way too often by recreational players (and not get bluffs through), playing a much more forward, faceup style is going to be more profitable than trying to find equilibrium with recreational players who aren't going to. That being said, if you played GTO versus them, yes, it would still be profitable, just not as much, as you could save EV by underbluffing and overfolding to turn/river aggression.

To reiterate though, this solid, ""low variance and mistake-free"" style of poker is NOT GTO. These players can be exploited by overfolding to their later street aggression. Versus an equilibrium player, they would be overfolding if they were to respond to aggression as they would to the loose passive live player. 

Yes, a lot of the players who are solver informed playing at the highstakes you'll see at the High Rollers have boring personalities. A lot of these guys are indeed more into theory of poker than the bravado and gamble of it, and yeah, the table demeanor and talk doesn't always make for captivating TV. That being said, a lot of the best poker content has been the Triton Series, where the GTO style of many of the players actually adds a lot of fuel to the recreational players. This hand  with [Mikita and Tony G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtJdNRi-s14) comes to mind - this is certainly not boring poker in terms of gameplay. 

Though it seems like part of PioSolvers Terms and Conditions are a vow of celibacy, the playstyle of ""GTO"" itself is nowhere near action dry.",1607305970

7460,Caution with bottom set in limped pot - Live 2-5,poker,"Limps around, 7-handed, hero calls in the SB with 2d2s as well.  We are 900 effective with the main villain.

(30)  Flop is 2c5d6h, checks to the cutoff, who will bet any 2 when checked to, and will give up on the turn+river if unimproved.  I flat call, since I think I need the cutoff to have a chance to pick up some piece of the board in order to get some value here - A raise will scare away all of his total junk.  UTG raises to 150.  I have had a hard time getting a read on UTG's playstyle, although I don't think he'd open limp 34o or 56o.

This is enormous sizing, I don't think he's doing this as a bluff, ever.  He doesn't strike me as the type of player who was going for the limp-raise with a big pocket pair preflop, although I can't say for sure, so I don't mind giving him a small handful of those combos.  Never going to fold a set to a single raise- I call.

(350)  Turn is Qd, I check, he bets 225, I call.  I think that flatting the 150 instead of 3betting keeps in his overpairs that might actually find a fold to a flop 3bet from me, and I think merely calling on the flop wins another bet from them here.  At this point, I think he has 56s, 34s, another set, or maybe 1/4 of the premium overpairs (JJ+) - This is mainly why I never considered raising, which I think would fold out the hands that I'm actually beating.

(800)  River is the Jd (Final board: 2c5d6hQdJd), I check, he checks back and flips over 5s6s, and I win.  This is the street I think I messed up on - Was I planning to call if he jammed for 525 more? - Since he checked back the next best hand, he's clearly not betting with anything I'm beating anymore.  Maybe I should jam and try to get a call out of his particular hand / a weirdly played AA / KK - Or a donk bet of 250, with the plan to fold to the jam, although I never actually would be able to follow through with that given the price.

Overall, despite winning, this hand left me with a really sour taste in my mouth, since he happened to show up with the exact hand that I think would call off a jam, even if I'd be behind if I jam and get called in most other cases.  It felt really wrong to play bottom set for its ""showdown value"", but I'm not sure what I could have done differently here.",1607301835
7461,Which is more important for determining the correct preflop sizing in different scenarios: Pot odds or Required Fold Equity (RFE)?,poker,"Basically, I have a preflop solution for one cash game setup from rangeconverter and I want to use it as a baseline for coming up with optimal sizes in different scenarios eg. different rake,open and 3 bet sizing of opponents, etc.

I've been generating bet sizing amounts for these different games using:

A) Raising the same % of the pot as rangeconverter suggests

and

B) Using the same RFE (Amount Risked/(Amount Risked+Dead Money)

But these give me different results, so I was wondering which one is the bigger driver of what my sizing should be preflop.

My gut tells me the pot odds I'm giving the opponent are more important, but I want to hear other people's thoughts.",1607299717

BB (BB): 82 BB  
UTG (UTG): 0 BB  
MP (MP): 43.8 BB

**Dealt to Hero:**

8c6c 

*fold*, MP calls 1 BB, CO calls 1 BB, **Hero raises to 3 BB**, *fold*, *fold*, MP calls 2 BB, CO calls 2 BB

This raise was a bit loose but I wanted to take advantage of the limpers in case I hit a big hand to build a big pot.   


Flop (10.4 BB, 3 players): 

AcJh8s

  
MP checks, CO checks, **Hero checks**

I could have bet here honestly but weak aces and jacks will check very often so I opted for the free card to hit 2 pair/flush  


Turn (10.4 BB, 3 players):

10c 

  
MP bets 2 BB, CO calls 2 BB, **Hero calls 2 BB**

I obviously don't fold and a raise here wouldn't make much sense.   


River (16.4 BB, 3 players):  
 Kc  
MP bets 2 BB, CO raises to 6.6 BB, **Hero calls 6.6 BB**, MP raises to 38.8 BB and is all-in, CO calls 32.2 BB, **Hero calls 32.2 BB**

&amp;#x200B;

This action made me INSANELY scared. I mean sure I have a flush here, but it's a fairly weak one and limpers will limp with ANYTHING I wouldn't be surprised by Qc5c or Jc3c. The fact that nobody bet the flop and the turn bet  was so small increases the possibility of draws by a lot but in the end I say my goodbyes to my chips and make a crying call. 

MP shows:

CO shows:  
Qd10d  
(Straight, Ace High)  
(Pre 39%, Flop 34%, Turn 24%)

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out I was the only one with a flush and this insane action was nothing but a bluff. But this made me wonder: how often am I getting bluffed when there is insane action like this? Normally I would just fold here but should I be calling more? I tend to overfold in 3 way pots and then see some shit hand like top pair take the win when they were repping straights and sets.

7472,Looking for learning material for 2NL 6max,poker,"Hello guys! Im a kinda fucked up guy IRL, and well, especially in things like poker. First, i want to talk a little bit about myself, so you can understand my situation better, and also since this is my first post in this sub.  
So im ADHD, and that means im utterly impulsive, can hyperfocus or not focus at all. I can fold AA-s preflop more than a normal person, i can missclick the raise button very often, i can do a lot of bullshit. But also, im kinda smart, in terms of logical thinking.   


In 2008 i registered to pokerstrategy, and played some SSS at NL10. About 300.000 hands. I read the strategy there, so im not new, i know the very very basic rules like pot-odds, and such things.   


I just recently started to play again, and well, as i see, i cant play SSS anymore, and seems like shorthand is the way to go. But i have no experience in this kind of games. I put 30euros on BET365 like 1.5 month ago, made it up to 120euros, lost it to about 70dollars. Then i went to pokerstars, made it to 182 in about 2weeks, and lost it again to 100. I mean, yes i had some crazy downswing due to bad luck, yes i could blame that, coolers, no flip, no draws finished. But thats not the real problem, you guys know it, and damn i know it too. I went to GGPoker now, because i felt like NL2 zoom on Pokerstars is just not for me, since ppl got datas now about my extremely easy to exploit plays, ppl just started to shit on me. So i went to the GGPoker site, first session +20dollars, no problem, woaaaa. But, now, im down to lets not talk about it... Enough to NL2 with a safe bankroll, but well... I started to feel extremely bad now. I dont wanna lose it. I can do it, but dont know how yet.  


Lets not talk about my prone to tilts. I work on that, and i even know how to. I started to meditate again, such things.   


Lets talk about my plays. What i feel is that im too tight. After about 160.000 hands my VPIP is 19 PFR is 14. I know that i should even have such a gap between. My 3bet is literally non existent, since it contains only JJ+, AK+, sometimes TT and KQs. I know its utterly weak. But i felt like its just way too uncomfortable for me to play 3bet pots with an AQs or such things. But this maybe not the real problem, i mean yeah these are leaks i know, i even went that far in the thight game, that in CO i wont even raise a KJs anymore, coz fuck sake, it made me so much trouble. But, thats my fault, and the problem is...  


My postflop play is literally -999999EV\\hand. Im way too aggresive with the cbets, also with the bet sizes. If i take 1-2days break its not that shit, but after a while i got something like a PTSD coz runner-runners, and literally got scared even on a rainbow board, that someone is holding a PP and gonna freakin kill me at the end. And whats happening? I pay out every single sets, 2 pairs, so on. I make the pot too big with TPTK, than i get depressed when i lose the pot, then i... So you got it. My postflop is shit.  


Also, i got scared against cbets too often. Have literally no idea when to call with lets say 2 overcards, and lets be honest, i need to learn everything, coz im shit AF.   
This is not SSS anymore, where i can play robotic, and go jam on flop. Too tricky for me, and and i got depressed now. Need help  


Please give me any arcticle, book, whatever can help me. Low stakes especially please, i dont want fancy stuff yet. Just basics. I would be happy if you could name a few good youtube videos where someone playing NL2 and playing it good. And books. Whatever, seriously.

Long story long, I am playing poker with a new group and we got in a little disagreement with the rules.  It was heads-up with two guys, one guy with a 6-2, one guy with a 6-8.  The table showed 6-K-6-Q-3 and I said ""split pot"" since they both had trip 6s with K-Q kicker.  All of them, even the guy with the pocket 6-2 said that pocket 6-8 wins.  They explained that you have to use both pocket cards, saying one had had trip 6s with K-2 kicker and the winning hand had K-8 kicker because you ""have to use both pocket cards.""  I disputed with ""so if you have a straight with one card but your other pocket card doesn't fit in the straight is it not a straight?""  They said that the straight with the highest ""kicker"" wins, and I said ""so you can have 6 cards in your hand?""  They said ""that's how we've always played it.""  I'm trying to find something in the Texas Hold 'Em rulebook where you don't have to use both of your pocket cards.  That and/or a video where this happens where somebody's kicker is the board, not their pocket card.  Something to show that this isn't just a ""house rule"" but an integral rule to playing poker.",1607286686

Do you have to convince your home game friends that you'll only play poker with them if they add PLO to the mix? I was thinking that most people that aren't really into poker like r/poker only know how to play Hold'em.

Which tools/videos/books do you use to study?  
I saw PokerStrategy has the PLO equity calculator for free. I have Jeff Hwang's first book on PLO...it seems nitty as it gets. I might be wrong since that's not my specialty. I'm not sure if he became loser in his later books.  


How are the swings though? I used to play HU SNGs since I also play chess and can relate them. The wackiest swings happened in Heads-Up games.

How difficult is it to find a PLO table at a casino that is NOT IN Las Vegas or Macau; just in a city not known for gambling?

Do you think PLO improves your Hold'em as well? I know the analogy of a 100m sprinter doesn't automatically become a good marathon runner and vice versa. You become good at what you practice, not everything similar to it. Does it apply to PLO/Hold'em?

What contributed to you to feel like, ""I understand this!"", and started crushing it? (or what is making you keep going if you're still not crushing it but haven't switched back to hold'em or another mental game: chess, Starcraft, Trading Card games, etc)",1607266313

7491,Opinion/Discussion: Large field PKO's (2000+ entrants) should never have a 50/50 pricepool distribution!!!,poker,"So yeah title pretty much says it all. I strongly believe these types of tourneys shouldn't even be a thing the way they are currently. I mean PKO's already have a ton of added variance then combine that with a huge field and the added variance shoots up exponetially. I really dont understand how they ever thought it's good to give those tourneys a 50/50 distribution. No one benefits from that, except maybe the ppl who bust super early and at least cash for half a buy in still. But tbh that happens to everyone at least 3 times a session so we shouldn't care about that aspect.

I think in these huge field PKO's bounties should only be the chery on top with a 75/25, or if the field gets insanely big (like 10k entrants), a 80/20 distribution. I just dont feel it is fair to the players to make these tourneys the way they are...Like honestly I don't wanna battle through thousands of players, just to f.e having to call off A10o of 60bb vs a 20bb all in ( which range is 80% of times on a better ace) with 5 ppl left because his bounty is so significant. I really think sites should look at these different options of distributing the money, with how much PKO's gained in significance in the online poker world over the last decade. I mean just look at the sunday milli today...It's gonna be a PKO with over 12k entrants and a 50/50 distribution.

i was wondering how I can better myself? I am for sure a winning player in this stakes, as I went from $50 to $170 atm. but its been a very slow grind.

i cant help but feel the massive player base is very nitty. i rarely see any call stations. so its very hard to print money....  only time people bet or even call opens is if they have face cards.

and even then, if they dont hit, or board looks scary, they all just insta fold.

i can only take small pots for so long, until someone wins it all back from me.

7500,Hand review: Micro PKO Tournament- Did i call correctly / Do you follow push/fold charts?,poker,"Hello r/Poker, would love to get your thoughts on my hand below as i'm trying to get better.

Stakes: Micro PKO. ($5.50 buyin)

I'm 34th out of the remaining 38 players on a tournament. (out of 639) i have an ""ok"" image, around 25VPIP. i have 9 BB remaining on BB, and have folded a bunch of smaller weaker connectors before this. (this'll be a question later on.)  


I'm dealt A2o on BB with 9 BB, UTG+2 open shoves with around 20BB. Folds around to me and i tank and eventually call.

A number of mistakes/assumptions here...

* Open shove on UTG+3 for 20 ish BB should have signified a strong hand.
* I would be flipping at best here if he had KQ, KJ or suited connectors.
* There is a small likelihood he's doing this to steal blinds, but that would be insanely risky considering there are a number of players to act behind and would have him covered.
* At the time i thought he'd have KQ, or KJ at best- and even then we'd be flipping. 
* To summarise, im not 100% certain why i called here, although i do know that based on Jonathan little's push/fold charts i should be shoving with Ax holdings with 9bb's. (this is a question later on.)

Villain had AQ and we had a clean no-pair run out. What are your thoughts above? To be clear im not asking for sympathy or how bad i run, etc. I'm wondering if any of my assumptions above made sense?

&amp;#x200B;

Also further questions:  


* Do you guys follow a push/fold chart? Certainly i'd be looking to shove with any pocket pair here, KJ, KQ, QJ holdings depending on my position/how many people are in preflop.
* What about suited connectors? i've folded a few smaller and bigger suited connectors (e.g. 23 suited or 9T suited) as i cant survive post flop if it missess, and i certainly dont think its a strong enough holding to shove with.

I just got back into poker a couple months ago and have been studying like crazy, but mostly for cash games (though it seems to translate well to early stages of tournaments). I've run quite well on 5nl cash games on Bovada, and i've tried a few MTT/SnG and final tabled a couple MTTs.  With my small sample of tournaments and only 13k cash game hands, it's difficult to tell what is more profitable if i want to get into poker seriously. 

I realize higher stakes are a long way out (though my 20 bucks is up 12x!), i just dont want to ""waste"" my study time focusing on specific cash game scenarios if that isnt the best route.

I see some old posts on reddit with the same/similar question, but it seems to change over the years. Does anyone have insight into the more profitible option?  The lastest info i've read says that tournaments have higher variance but cash has more difficult player pools.  Assuming this is still the case, do they roughly equal out with profit in the long run (assuming equally skilled at each), or do tournaments/cash gain an edge?

Flop comes out 9c8sJc., giving me an open-ended straight draw and second pair. OOP, I check and UTG bets $0.21 into the pot of $0.34. Turn comes 9h, giving me 3 of a kind. Good for me, or so I think. 

I check again, and UTG bets $0.46 into the pot of $0.76. I raise him up to $1.22 in the hopes of charging him for any flush or straight draws. I put him on a J or a draw with his bet sizings. 

To my surprise, he goes All-in ($6.84, but I only have $3.37 so $3.37 effective) into the pot of $2.44. With 3 of a kind and an open-ended straight draw, I obviously call. He turns over JJ for the higher Three of a Kind.

V is a young white guy.  In the ten hands since he's sat down, he's opened 5 of them, and he's fired small cbets with 4 of them, even in multiway pots.  In one of these, he got to showdown with Q8o, that he opened from early position over a limper.  In the most recent one, I put in the 3bet bluff with As2s, hit my 2, fired a small cbet, got called, and gave up on the turn and river to show it down.  (I beat his Ace-King, lol).  I don't know if he's a ""good"" LAG or not, but I tend to give a little more credibility in terms of talent towards young white guys who open a bit looser.

If it matters, hero is also a young white guy.

On to the hand:

He opens to 20 from the LJ, I flat call on the Button with JsTs.  3betting here seems bad since my 3bet credibility is totally ruined, I'm actually ahead sometimes, and the SB will call along with any 2 if I just flat.

SB calls and BB folds.

(60)  Flop AsKc2c.

SB checks, he bets 25, I call, SB folds.  Gotta make sure he's not just trying to steal it.

(110).  Turn is 6s.  He bets 80, I call.  Feels like we have too much equity here to fold, even though I think this turn bet is much more credible than his flop bet.

(270)  River is the 2h.  He checks.  I don't know how he'd play his monsters like A6s, AK, AA, or KK here, so idk if this is a trap or not.  At the same time, any A is pretty much the effective nuts, but I think he has a lot of snap folds with bricked clubs and broadway draws, many of which are all ahead of me.

7552,COVID-19 Running Rampant At My Home Game...,poker,"My weekly home game that I go to has been great in the past regarding CoViD-19. Everyone has worn masks and there was a strict rule of applying hand sanitizer after every hand (CoViD-19 has been shown to spread easily through surface contact). If you didn't follow these rules, you weren't allowed to play. 

Recently, the host also installed plexiglass dividers, further ensuring our safety from this highly infectious respiratory virus. I also wear gloves (and put on fresh ones after every hand) but only about half of players follow my lead. I guess this is OK because we are required to use hand sanitizer after every hand anyways. I will take off my old gloves, discard them, do the hand sanitizer, then put on a fresh pair of gloves. The sight of other players' bare hands abhors me, but it's barely tolerable because of how soft the game is. Moving on.

I have started to notice some of the players becoming lax about their habits. Certain players will fidget with their masks, reducing their effectiveness. And, some players have even taken their masks off entirely! They said they were ""having trouble breathing"". Riiight. I get that it's been a while, but this is called pandemic fatigue, and it's unacceptable. They take them off only for a couple seconds at a time, but even minor non-compliance cannot be tolerated.

I'm wondering what the most effective approach to dealing with these players is. I've asked the host to ""handle them"", but these guys are a little rough around the edges, and sometimes threaten the host. So we're in a bit of a pickle. I wear a thin bandana as my face covering, which does a good job blocking the microscopic particles of the virus from entering and exiting my body.

I may ""gift"" the problematic players poker-themed bandanas (such as with a graphic of two aces, ""pocket rockets"") and say: ""Wear this, then put your mask on top. If you remove your mask, you will still have an effective face covering"". However, confrontation isn't my strong suit, and there is the real risk of one of these players getting violent if he happens to be on tilt when I open my mouth, no matter how passive aggressive I am. Fighting, and general fitness, is also not an area of my expertise, so I'd like to call these people out, but I also don't want to get into a confrontation because of my beliefs.

7554,You think your poker story sucks?Here’s a little story,poker,"Hi! Back on full tilt days I was a pretty big reg on the lower limits. By year two I accumulated 150,000 playing 100 and 200 nl heads up. I was probably the biggest winner for nl 100 on the site for a long time. I have many many millions of hand histories.

Fast forward 4 years and my account is around 700k, 99% grinded from low stakes. I got addicted to drugs, took a shot and lost it all 50k at a time to this guy who I swear was a super user (biggest variance I had in a long time for the highest stakes I ever played, and the guy was calling off 100k with two pair in Omaha vs nuts 1 card to come and hit like 8 times in a row for my biggest pots ever in similar fashion.

Now I retire and get super depressed and addicted. Almost killed myself since I didn’t know anything about staking or anything. My life was poker. I quit school and work to pursue my dreams. It was now over and I was not motivated to go back to slave labor or school after I got a taste of the good life.



Fast forward 6 months. My cousin asks how I’m doing I tell him I lost it all playing way out of character and that I’m abusing opiates to cope. He told me with my stats to check out two plus two staking forums. I upload my graph with 10+ mil hands. It goes straight up, you’ve never seen a graph quite like it. I check the people’s stats applying.   Not anyone had my volume or consistency, not even close, by the first day I had 6 people staking me for about 3 grand total. I get it to 20k within the month. I was up on 4 accounts and down 500 only on one. I had the bankroll to grind back up and quit being staked. I cash out 500 for food and gas on one account, and the next day I’m banned from the site. I go on two plus two and the guy was a moderator and ran like 6 of the poker sites people were using. He flagged me as someone who broke contract and told every person to withdraw my money. I had 20k seized over a 500 dollar cash out, and the worst part is I was up 6 grand on that account, so he took the profits and blacklisted me for life on the forums.

It gets worse. A few months later Black Friday happens. I got my yahoo email hacked which had all my poker hands saved for the last 5 years of playing. All gone. Yahoo didn’t have customer support or anything so my hand histories were gone forever. This was my sign to quit poker and focus on getting clean from opiates. I got clean. Life has been so sad and boring since all of this happened. I was world class at something and helped poker grow when it was in its infant stages, all gone. 

Someone will say “if you’re so good just grind it back.” It’s hard. Once you’ve mastered something and lost the drive to keep mastering it it becomes just a job, not as exciting as when you first learned it. This train of thought applies to everyone I’ve ever heard of that was super passionate about anything. Its taken me this many years to get the humility and passion to even think of taking it seriously again. It’s been many many years and Every single time I tried to play again I just didn’t have the drive, and Black Friday ruined my poker tracking software business me and my friend started. We had the number 1 tracking software in the us at one point (it was in beta for free and we had millions of users using it including durrrr and Ivey alongside a phone app program all the big names used to text when fish would get on) Black Friday lost us easily a million dollar company.

How does one find the passion to reset his ego and mental and start a new? Nothing in 10 years has come close to the fulfillment I felt when I was playing for a living.

I wish I took my friends offer to move to Europe once it got banned in the USA to live in a poker house. He’s retired now and I eventually stopped talking to anyone who was still playing. I want to make a comeback. Passion is everything to me and I think after this many damn years I should be ready to go all in with it and reignite the fire.

7555,Playing against short-stacked,poker,"At my local card house, 80% of the player pool buys in for less than 100 bb, usually 50- 75 bb range.  I’ve been playing mostly 5 NL and 10 NL and always top off, so playing against mostly short-stacked is uncharted territory for me.  


I have a couple questions:
1. Should I be buying in the max or just over the effective stack?  Should I buy in for the max or at least 100 bb?
2. How should I be playing hands like small pocket pairs and suited connectors preflop?  I usually 3 bet suited connectors to hit a nice draw with good implied odds and flat with pocket pairs for set mining at deeper tables.
3. When I do hit a draw with my hands, especially since the SPR is low, should I be shoving on the flop to maximize fold equity?

They froze me..
Maybe a month two months later after long unanswered emails they unfreeze me.
They told me never to play on a second account. I swore I wouldn't and since then I never did..

Now months later out of nowhere they freeze my account saying it's because I have a second account associated with mine.
I have not used any other account except for the one that I'm supposed to use since the issue was resolved with pkertars back in February but either way I'm frozen out and it has been weeks. 

I assumed when they allowed me to play again in the first place the issue was resolved.
I never deleted the play money account because I was mainly afraid when they told me never use a second account that even logging into the second play money account just to delete would show up as me using a second account again and would give me a permanent ban so I just didn't use it again.
Now I don't even remember the email or the user ID or what account they're saying is associated with mine, I don't know how to delete it and they've not answered me and it's been weeks.

Hero stack: $142 Villian stack: $50

Villain (UTG) opens to $1.25, Hero (UTG+1) 3b to $2.50 w/ AJd, Villain 4b to $6.50, Hero calls

\*At this point it's worth noting that I'd been sitting at the table with Villain for 2 or 3 hours and he had played pretty tight pre to this point, a few 3b's and this may have been his first 4b.

Flop: As 8c Kd

Villain bets $4.5, Hero calls

Turn: 5c

Villain bets $16, Hero tanks ... here I'm thinking Villain could have me dominated with AK, AQ, KK based on his tight pre-flop play up until this point. Ended up making the fold and Ignitions rabbit showed Js was coming on the river lol.

Regardless of that rabbit river card, was this a weak sauce fold? I suppose based off my read AK, KK would still have me dominated and could've cost me a lot more $$, but am I giving Villain too much credit here?

7624,Thought of the Day,poker,"Had a quick thought that I figure might be worth some discussion. 

The main theme of this thought is ""will poker die soon"". 

Everyone hears about the glory days of the late 90's/early 2000's poker boom when everyone was a fish, GTO wasn't a thing. No one understood EV, position, stack sizes, etc., let alone how to properly range. 

Fast forward some 20 odd years and now there are software programs solving the game for us. Its almost as if poker has become strictly about memorization and equity analysis (math), and im wondering where we will be in 20 years. 

My theory is the game will be a net null outcome as GTO theory starts to level across all playing fields. 

Since GTO is always keeping EV at 0, wouldnt this lend itself to the game eventually becoming pointless?

I'm wanting to dive deeper into my training and put in more time off the felt, but im also worried about being late to the boat. 

I guess my real question is: Is it worth it to start diving in now? Will this game be a pointless game of 0 EV due to GTO play?

Any discussion and insight is appreciated. Thanks!",1607099412

7627,Gigantic punt or tough spot?,poker,"First caveat: This was a super weird table. Players were limping very wide and then overvaluing medium-strength hands (AA on T9973hhh, but plenty of other examples that don't include preflop premiums etc) so I pivoted to a strategy that included overlimping many holdings that could make big hands. Ironically I basically ended up making the same mistake they did, which is a lesson in itself, but I'm still curious about how to think about this turn decision in a vacuum.

MGMNH $1/3, V1 in BB and V2 in HJ both have roughly $300, hero covers. 

Family pot limps around to hero with Ah2d, hero completes, BB checks.

Flop is 3d4h5c, hero leads for $10 into $15. Three callers including V1 and V2. 

Turn is Kd, hero leads for $25 into about $50 after rake. V1 calls, V2 raises to $80 and has $200 behind.

I obviously don't like having the ass end of straight. I know he can have 67 here, and probably 16 combos of it. But at the same time, per table dynamics, I think he can have all the sets (even KK probably, it would not have been the first premium to be limped.) I do not think he has semi-bluffs like 87dd or 86dd or AdXd.

In theory, I want to say bad end of the straight is not good enough to jam here. But I decide he can have worse value, and I also make a read that players with the current nuts at $1/3 tend to slow play (though perhaps the BDFD changes that a bit) and so I discount 67 slightly. So I jam. The results are that V1 (!) calls, and V2 snaps and has 67 and we're drawing dead. V1 doesn't show.

Maybe this is just a cooler but assuming my jam is too aggressive here, what is our plan? Folding seems out of the question. Calling seems fine, but aren't we going to find ourselves in the same spot on most rivers? We can find a fold on a board pair or a diamond probably. But if he did have a set or some kind of FD, doesn't that mean we WANT to have ripped it on the turn? I guess it just feels sort of paradoxical: If we don't raise so we can fold bad rivers, then his holdings that care about the rivers are the ones we wanted to jam against. 

Basically I just **feel** like jamming was an overplay, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around how call is more +EV. How should I think about this turn/river dynamic?",1607094145

7629,SharkScope Not Recognizing SitNGo Tournaments,poker,"I play on ACR and use Sharkscope as my HUD and for bankroll tracking. I haven't had any complains so far until now. It appears that SharkScope is not recognizing SitNGo tournaments. It imports the tournament results, but it does not recognize them as SitNGos. This means that it is impossible to track results by SitNGo or by stake within SitNGos. I also play large MTT tournaments with the same buy in and I would like to filter out these results to just look at SitNGos. 

Here is an example description from WPN of one of the tournaments that cannot be imported:

Tournament #2304\*\*\*\* - Holdem(No Limit) - $20 Hold'Em Turbo - On Demand GAMETYPE - Hold'em LIMIT - n

It appears that ""On Demand"" tournaments are not categorized as SitNGos by WPN or by SharkScope, and so they are not importing as such. This is a change from over the summer when they did not have this label.

Hero is SB with As 5s. LJ (60 BB effective) makes it’s 2.2 BB. I make it 6.4 BB to go and he calls in position. (In hind set I should’ve chose a bigger sizing since I was out of position) 

We got to a flip of 2c Js  7c (pot is 14.14 BB)

I Cbet 5 BB and he calls. After thinking about it this might be a donk bet. My rationale was that flush draws, JJ, and over pairs are all in my range and I block A J. He has plenty of hands that completely miss the flop, I admit so do I. 

We go to a turn of the Q s (pot is now 24BB). The flush draw gets there. 

I lead out for 7.5 BB and he calls. 

This is a great turn card. I have flush equity now and the over card is good for my range. 

The river is a blank. I check he shows K J of hearts. 

Im not sure if I should just check fold this on the flop or just continue with the third barrel ok the river. After thinking about it more I think I should check fold it but if I was in the position I was in on the river I should’ve triple barreled. I think I make a lot if the K J too fold after facing so much pressure. 

Id love to hear your thoughts/criticism!",1607074874

Flop is QsJs4o. Pot is about 3.00

Mid bets 1.50. I raise all in. Folds back to Mid who calls.

My thinking here is that this flop is very wet and hit both other players range pretty well. The donk flop bet is a little weird but it makes me think he has a draw and is trying to see turn for cheap. I think I should definitely raise here but I dont know about sizing. If I raise to say 4.50 that leaves me with 4.50 into a pot of 12 on the turn. Basically I'm always getting it all in and never folding here and I hope he has a good draw.

7699,Tough tournament spot. $22 bounty tournament Partypoker,poker,"I'll preface this by saying I'm not a tournament expert. I play far more cash so I find these close spots confusing.

Hero is 55/250 with 130 paid. Can probably min cash by playing very conservative. 

Hero has ATcc in BB. MP shoves his 4.5bb stack with $11 bounty. SB insta shoves and covers hero. 

If this was any other player in the tournament I would sigh and muck my hand. But this particular player was extraordinarily aggressive. He has jammed multiple times over people with 35bb. In one hand I called his  LJ open and watched him rip it in on a 346r flop for 88bb. I'm pretty sure he's the type of player to be getting out of line.

Plus the insta shove. Would anyone really do that with a premium hand? I dont believe it. You'd want to entice the BB. 
All this said, I'm thinking his range likely consists of pairs from 22-TT, almost any Ax, KJ+, QJ+, JTs, maybe even worse hands. 

I realize that I am probably flipping, but there is a bounty, and doubling my stack would put me in the top 10.

Flop comes KcQc5d

I check, both players check behind. 

Turn is the Jd. 

I turn some equity now having a flush draw and a gut shot straight draw, I decide to lead out for $20. Both players call. 

River is the Js. 

The flush draws missed, I have 10 high and I decide to bluff at it. Being that I bet the jack on the turn I figured I could represent trip jacks. I lead out for $50.  The cutoff looks at me and shakes his head smiling, probably thinking “this lucky motherfucker”, and lays his hand down. The button thinks for a second, then shows his hand and says”, I don’t think 10 high is good here”, then let’s it go and I win the pot.

I then turn over my hand and say I think we would’ve chopped and the table couldn’t believe it lol.

7701,Balancing VPIP/PFR and SPR,poker,"Premises with which I enter this question include:

\- A reasonable VPIP is between 35 (loose) and 18 (tight)

\- A reasonable PFR should be between 3 and 8 points lower than one's VPIP (aggressive)

\- Drawing hands such as suited connectors want an SPR of at least 10

Given the frequency of being dealt hands that want a larger SPR, we will often want to just call a single raise when we have position, lowering our PFR. Too often, in my experience, to permit our PFR to remain as close to our VPIP as is instructed by the poker gurus I follow, such as Johnathan Little, James Sweeney, and the authors of Professional No Limit Hold 'em Vol. 1. Through 3,800 hands using a HUD, I have a 24/15, and I try all I can to close that gap. The cash games I play carry no antes, so defending the big blind is a concern I have largely jettisoned, allowing me to play less hands into which I have only called, and still... Nine point gap.

It seems to me impossible to play loose and aggressive while also obeying the three premises above. How can these demands all square?",1606946669

V2 is somewhat tighter, but not much, in his preflop calls, and maybe a little aware of V1.

Both V's limp to me in the SB with KhTh, I make it 25, and both call.

(75)  Kd8c3d.  I check to induce a bet from V1, who makes it 40, and V2 calls.  When V2 calls, this looks like diamonds / a weakish king (He would have opened KJ+ preflop, and I think he could have kings as weak as K5s here) / an underpair to the King, like 99 or 89s, or sometimes a trapped set / K8 exactly.  KT is pretty strong against a lot of those, so I put in the check-raise to 140, V1 folds, and V2 unfortunately calls.  I decide on the raise instead of calling, because I think I'm getting some value from diamonds and most of his Kings - Plus, it's not like V1 has no equity - it would suck for him to hit trips or some whacky 2 pair - obviously this is a disaster if V2 was trapping stronger holdings on the flop.

(395)  Turn is the Ah.  I check, and V2 ships it for 300.  I fold.  I checked because at least some of his diamond draws hit an Ace, and I can't beat those anymore.  Plus, if he wants to keep throwing money into the pot after the flop check raise, he's clearly not afraid of many hands.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ignition - $0.05 NL (6 max) - Holdem - 6 players** 

Hero (BN): 103 BB

Villain (HJ): 140 BB

HJ opens to $.15 I call with Jh8h. This was a loose call, I should have folded.  

&amp;#x200B;

Flop: Qd 8c 9c

&amp;#x200B;

Villain bets $.18, I call ofc.

&amp;#x200B;

9d comes on the turn and I get excited. Villain bets slightly more than half pot, but I have enough outs to justify the call. I'm excited about hitting a big hand and call

&amp;#x200B;

The river comes 2d and Villain leads for $.80 but I see this as a bluff opportunity. I assumed villain was value betting a queen and might fold on the river given the runout. I check raise to $3.16 and get snap called.

&amp;#x200B;

This raise is bad for several reasons. For one the sizing is far too large, I would get similar fold equity for a more reasonable raise. Would A 9 be betting like this? What better hands am I getting to fold? Villain's range is almost exclusively full houses and straights, with top pair if I'm lucky.  An argument can be made for calling here sometimes because he's occasionally gonna have missed draws and overcards, but those will 90% be checking on the river and probably wouldn't bet the turn that large. He's always betting his set, full house, straight, or any other goodies he might have so I'm bleeding money more often than not. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question here isn't if this bluff was good or bad, but if I should have semi-bluff raised the turn instead, or just folded when I missed my draws. Which would be better? Also, what kind of boards would be good for a check raise river bluff?",1606927766

7725,Looking for a poker related job!,poker,"Hi guys,


My name is Michael and I am looking for a poker related job. I recently stopped playing poker professionally. In my career I have played stakes up to 200nl online. I have extensive knowledge on poker and almost all pokersoftware including solvers.


My previous job experience has been as a chef in a restaurant but due to covid it is extremely hard to find a job in my area so I am trying to leverage my poker knowledge and experience to find a job. I currently live in the Netherlands and speak both Dutch and English.


If your poker related company needs extra hands I am very eager to work as, but not limited to:
* Poker news/strategy/content writer
* Customer support agent
* Marketing/Social media manager
* Personal assistant
* Basic video editor 
* Accountant
* Any other poker related job you might have for me.



I am available 40 hours a week but am also open to part time positions. 


If you have a position for me please email me at michaelvb101@gmail.com or add me on skype for a chat/call. Username: michaelvb101


I hope to hear from you if you have any open positions.



Kind regards,
Michael",1606922972
7726,Fish Question - Cash vs Tourneys?,poker,"Last month I lost 12 Tourneys in a row (meaning $0 payout), all were low buy-ins but the losses hurt just the same so I've been going through some old posts for advice. 

I get the impression that a lot of players are Cash or Tourney but not both. My best interpretation is that this is due to them being two entirely different skill sets and mind sets.

Is that a fair statement? If so then I need to stop wasting my precious $5 buying in to tourneys and use that money to keep grinding 5NL.

You get 2 points for each bet, no matter the size, while you get 1 point for a call, no points for checking.

I was thinking that maybe, because of this promo, it would be a good strategy to surrender some EV in the game by changing my checks in head up pots to Min bets, when I'm OOP (so I won't reopen the betting for the villain).

This could easily get a buy in or even more in a day of profit in the best case, as the higher places pay quite well. But obviously this isn't the best strategy in the game.. What do you think?",1606914152
7734,"Looking for a ""multi-game ranking system"" to play with friends",poker,"Hey everyone!    
    
The scenario is pretty simple (and probably very common for most of you), I have some friends that want to get into poker but: a) they don't feel comfortable playing with money; b) the game just turns into a mess when no one values their chips =&gt; not fun.    
    
""Bragging rights"" aren't really a thing if you just play one game, so what I'm looking for is some sort of existing system that allows you to track the ranking of a group of players over time. It's not like it means that much more, but it surely should help motivate people to try to improve their rank every time.    
    
I tried to come up with something myself but it's super scuffed:  
\- Points earned after each game: For a table of 8, 1st place gets 8pts, 2nd get 7pts, ..., 8th gets 1pts. Exponential instead of linear distribution of points might also be interesting.  
\- The new points total for a player is equal to the earned points in the last game + some fraction of the total points the player had before. This makes recent games more valuable than old ones, allowing new player to catch up. For example, a player ended up in 3rd (out of 8) last game and had 20pts before that: 6pts + 0.75 \* 20pts = 21pts. (you wouldn't apply this fraction if you were doing a tournament with only 3 or 4 games, though)

The dealer accidentally flips the 6 of hearts when dealing to Tan Xuan and announces “6 of hearts was exposed.” Somehow the card isn’t dead and Tan Xuan takes the card. He then proceeds to 4bet bluff with Q6hh. Tom Dwan, the 3-bettor, folds KJdd, even though he should know Xuan has a 6 in his hand.

Did the broadcast get the hole cards wrong? Was it edited incorrectly? But it does look like the dealer pushes the 6h to Xuan, and you can see in other angles Xuan is sitting at that exact spot.

Wtf happened? The best hand Xuan could’ve had is 66 or A6hh, so Dwan should’ve shoved. I’m so confused.",1606888155

back then, i was a huge winning player. (but who wasnt that had a decent understanding of poker theory right?)

Currently, i am not sure if i can say i am a winning player. but i have doubled my first real initial bank roll on ignition (not much. initially deposited $30 to make sure everything works fine. Bitcoin wise, transfer wise, client/gameplay wise. before I lost it all. I then deposited $80 again and now currently sitting at ~~$160)

For the past couple years, ive been lurking on this subreddit following along, so i am, on paper, used to live poker bet sizes. But I have always like online poker bet sizes as it feels more like you're playing a 100bb buy ins. But I am still not used to sizing online. But even moreso for live poker.

I have never played in a casino before, but i know bet sizes gets crazy, as a standard bet size.

with those bet sizes, and sitting at 100bb, you're basically short stack, and almost the same thing as playing with a straddle. 

i mean, how can you justify opening/3betting A10s on the btn live poker, when the standard open is 8-12bb? and a standard 3bb is like another 5x the open? the SPR is basically always insane.

if you had great implied odds, fine. But how often are you going to be ""deep stack"" vs ""deep stack"".

I've been tasked with hosting a poker game for our annual holiday party for everyone at my office. No one has a poker account so everyone will create one on stars. New accounts start with 35K chips. What are your thoughts on the best way to do this? I'd like the game to last 60-90 minutes.

Basically, my options are:

1. Tournament: only con here is that once someone is out they kind of have to sit around and wait. I guess this is fine.

-Smallest tourney on stars home game is 20K chips so that's what I'd have to make it. Meaning I can't do a rebuy because everyone will only have 35K chips.
-What kind of tournament structure would you recommend for a 60-90 minute game with 13 people? Turbo I guess? Any other structures I should consider?


2. Play money cash game.
The con here is that not everyone can play together since max table size is 9 people. Same is true for tourney but at least at some point everyone remaining will sit on one table.


In both cases, the prizes will be given out by firm to the winner (in cash whoever has most/2nd most chips or 1st/2nd place in tourney).

7828,"My Poker Journey, From Online Crusher, to Feared Live Pro",poker,"\*record scratches\*

Yep that's me. You're probably wondering how I got to betting my last $15 preflop at 5NL. It all started when I was twelve years old with a little something called Luigi picture poker. This was obviously before I was even into furry porn, and my life still held promise for the future. Now, my wife has left me, I've still never had sex, and I've finally lost the custody battle for my three children. This is my story.

By any metric I was a young whipper snapper. My historic run at 25NL really was something out of a comic book, and anyone who saw me play agreed that I had what it took to play 100KNL with The Baron and Linus. I started playing when I was only thirty-two, stealing my mother's credit card from off her dresser whenever she made the mistake of leaving it out in the open, usually maxing it out to as much of the $500 spending limit that remained on it. She was a single mother, my father had left when I was only seventeen, leaving her to care for me alone. She worked hard at the casino slots to provide for herself and me, and my dream with poker, the thing that kept me focused through all the bad beats and variance, was to one day repay her for everything she had done for me. 

My career had no doubt been a rocky one, but after over three years of playing I had finally run up a FIVE HUNDRED dollar bankroll, which was enough to take a shot. To make my move. I was headed to the Borgata in Atlantic City to play $5/$10 Unlimited Texas Hold Them poker, minimum buy-in $500. I knew I was ready. You see, online poker is a LOT tougher than live poker, and the adversity I had endured molded and chiseled me into a world class player, both in terms of technical skill, and making big hands. That very night, my mom had just kicked me out for using her credit card without permission again (women, right?), but I wasn't worried one bit. Because I knew. Tonight, I'd be rich.

I got to the casino that night around 3:00 pm. I was ready to play, to bring my best in a world-class lineup, and I knew I'd fit right in. I picked up my rack of chips, and took a seat to prove my worth. I played tight for an hour, folded mostly. Then I made a score. Rags. I opened the CO with pocket fours to $30 and the button snap-3bet me to $130. He knew I was new. But I had seen this guy 3bet before, and this time I wouldn't be pushed around. I bet all-in! THREE HUNDRED and TWENTY ONE dollars! I was gonna put this punk to the test. And you know what happened? He CALLED me with Ace Nine off suit! I was repping ACES, and he called me with ace nine off suit. The board ran out KK993. Sometimes the fish get lucky and there's nothing you can do. All you can do is get it in good. Devastated I checked my online account for any rakeback I might have. I threw it down at 5NL. This was my last stand. I quickly doubled, my KJs sucking out against AK for 150bb preflop, classic cooler turned bad beat when I turned the nut straight. And so everything was ready for the final hand. I opened the CO J7dd, and the button 3bet me to 10bb. I had seen this before an knew he was weak. I 4bet big. He 5bets. I knew what I had to do. There comes a time in every man's life where he has to make a choice between the right way, and the easy way. And I'll go to my grave proud of the choice I made that day, to 6bet all-in.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm broke now but I'm more than happy to get staked for my main game, $5/$10 at the Borgata.",1606803378
7829,True story about an unfortunate encounter I had with Daniel Negreanu,poker,"I posted this as a comment in another thread but wanted to share here as well for visibility...

*Making this post for the sole purpose to give some insight to Daniel Negreanu and his character from an encounter I had with him January of 2010. I sat next to Daniel at a restaurant, we got along, mentioned to him that my friend and I were doing a horseback trail/beach riding excursion. He laughed said he might be interested, we exchanged numbers and I left a few minutes later. I text him that night telling him the price/time and he says why the hell not, and so it was set.*

*Next day comes and the van comes to pick us up, he seemed excited said he hadn't ridden a horse in years, we had that in common so I guess we were a little nervous. I tried to joke around a bit telling him that the professionals ride with both legs on one side, and I hope to be that good one day. Few people laughed but I thought it was funny and thats all that matters lol. So we get to the horses, everyone gets on, and we are off. The 1st 10 min is a slow beach walk, and I'm behind Daniel, and my friend behind me. I was snapping pics and videos to send to friends (this is before snapchat) and then out of nowhere Daniel swings his legs to one side, and starts riding side saddle. I took a 8-10 second video of this, we had some laughs, and I put my phone away. We finish the trail and are back at the hotel bar in about 90 minutes.*

*This is the part that I will never forget and has truly stopped me from befriending strangers, or at least made me more wary. I pull out my phone and start showing some pictures, I told him I would text him photos of him because as he put it ""my friends won't believe I did this"". I get to the video of him riding side saddle. My friend and I start laughing our asses off, as you can imagine how hilarious this looks. He gets red almost immediately. ""Delete that \*\*\*\* right now"" ""That is the gayest thing ever I don't know why I did it"" At first I thought he was kidding, but he reassured me, ""If you don't delete that I will break your phone"" and he grabbed at my phone. I told him to relax, and what was the big deal. He said he was ""big online"" and that if the video got out people would talk \*\*\*\*. Looking like he was about to cry, I took my phone, deleted the video in front of him, he made sure it was fully deleted, then said ""I knew something was \*\*\*\*ed up about you guys"" and walked away.*

*I had only occasionally thought about that night, until I started seeing his recent online freakouts. I would randomly google his name, and see him doing well in wsop and was some what happy for him getting his \*\*\*\* together. Now reading and hearing about him again prompted me to tell this story, and at least give another perspective of Daniel Negreanu...*",1606802256

I'm doing both cash and tournament at the moment, I know that you should usually focus on one but because I am still in the low stakes I'm just the most comfortable with by playing both. So what should I start learning and looking into, right now what I do is analyze some of my hands and try to figure out where I go wrong when I do, and I think that one of my strengths is my intuition however I know that a lot more is needed to be a profitable player.

I'm not talking about losing 20% hands.  I've been doing the math on hands I've lost, and I keep losing to 6% river flops, or people who have no right in staying in the pot due to equity and just somehow getting there on the river.  Lost the nut flush to a straight flush on the river, for instance before final table, or fish who stayed until the river despite having no equity against aggressive raises and hit the river causing me to lose nearly half my stack.  I've tracked how many times I've gone heads up with KK since about two weeks ago, and pocket kings has lost 9/14 times heads up.  This is mostly against trash hands like 94o that call for some reason.  Of the times I've gone all in with AK/AA preflop, I've lost to straights about 75% of the time (16/21 times I've been tracking.)

I understand that poker has a lot of variance and that I'm new, I haven't put in the volume.  I only have about 100 MTT's under my belt, and a good amount probably haven't lasted for a few levels.  It is just incredibly discouraging when I'm trying to make the correct decisions and it feels like I'm getting punished leaving me confused as what to learn from the situation.  My range isn't perfect, but it's definitely on the tighter side so I don't feel like I'm getting into pots without at least good odds (And I know when to get out if it's looking bad by the flop or turn, or if villain raised/reraised I know to get out with marginal holdings stack size considered.)  I know I make a lot of mistakes and I'm not trying to say my play is infallible, it isn't.  It just seems like I've had a lot of incredibly bad beats these past few weeks and as a starting player it makes me wonder if I'm doing something wrong (probably) or if I just need to keep doing what I'm doing and roll with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Without trying to make this a 'woe is me' post, I want to finish it by asking if there are any good books on MTT's I can maybe try studying or any other resources?  I've done a quick google search but there seems to be hundreds of books, some of them from years ago and may not be super relevant to what the scene looks like now.  Finally, I play on betOnline if anyone has any specific advice for that site.  From what I understand, this site is notoriously soft which is great for cash games but leads to much higher variance in MTT's where it's easier to get sucked out with good hands.  I mostly play in micros but definitely don't feel like moving up is good for my bankroll or skill level as even the micro tournaments are hard for me to win with.

7888,Tournament - Deep run - ICM considerations,poker,"Hey guys, not your typical HA here, but I felt like poking the mass and just listen to opinions, how ever relevant they may be.  


\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

context;

Standard rebuy tournament structure, final table, 5 left stack sizes;

**Hero --&gt; 36BB**

**Villain 1 --&gt; 38BB**

**Villain 2 --&gt; 11BB**

**Other --&gt; 14BB**

**Other --&gt; 15BB**

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

So we are pretty happy here, obviously looking great for a win, and just come off another tournament win. This final table is fish heavy, only 1 other person at the table isn't a complete fish and they are sitting at roughly 40% of my stack with 15BB.

Villain 1 and Villain 2 are both fish. Villain 1 is unpredictable, won't necessarily play completely out of line preflop, but is somewhat out of line and will call extremely wide post flop. Villain 1 will also be fairly aggressive with extremely large sizing whenever he gets a piece of the flop. Villain 2 is a fish, only real information is that his sizing is usually wrong (3X open at the final table when sitting with OK stack).  


\&amp;nsbp;

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok enough subjectivity, here is the hand:**  


\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

**Villain 2 - UTG - 11BB**

**Hero - SB - 36BB**

**Villain 1 - BB - 38BB**

**Hero is dealt QTss**

**Villain 2 opens for 2BB, fold, fold, Hero elects for a 3Bet of \~6BB, villain 1 calls, villain 2 folds.**

&amp;#x200B;

**\&amp;nbsp;**

&amp;#x200B;

**flop --&gt; QhQd8h**

**Hero checks, villain bets 15BB, Hero ????**

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;nbsp;

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so obviously, this is a dream spot, but my question is more in regards to ICM and the crushing realization that going all-in here, and most certainly getting called, would be crushing for ICM lets say for example that villain has AKhh and gets there. And there are definitely hands that have us crushed that could be within villains range; AQs and AQo, KQs and KQo, QJs and QJo, 88.  


Now this is an absolutely slam dunk easy jam in most situations (cash games etc...), but I was wondering considering the significant edge on the final table, are good position in relation to shorter stacks, is it something we should at least consider folding? Obviously you can also comment on the decision to 3bet QTss versus just calling for example.

I will post results after, they are somewhat unexpected, but I am wondering truthfully if some of you guys would consider folding this hand ever, or you just decide to live your faith.

The dealer told him he'd have to either pay for the spot or sit it out til the button passed him, but he insisted on some convoluted bullshit where he pays the small blind twice and skips the button...I honestly can't remember because he spent half the time trying to name drop famous people he'd dealt for.

This was a $.05/$.10 NL game on Ignition. I get dealt 9c8c UTG and raise it up to $.40 into the .25 pot ($.40 because another player just joined and opted to pay the $.10 mandatory blind). Only BB calls. I start the hand with $2.32 behind ($2.02 at this point) and he had $8.14 ($7.84 at that point) behind.

Flop comes Td9sJs. I have bottom pair and an open ended straight draw. 

Villian checks to me and I bet $0.68 into the pot of $1.05 (3/4 pot bet). This will get weaker draws like a gutter to fold and protect my pair. He makes the call. At this point, the pot is $2.41 and I have $1.24 behind.

Turn comes 4d. I go all in with my $1.24.

He calls and reveals 7d8s for the flopped straight.

River comes 8d which improves me to two pair, but alas won't help against a straight.

7948,Illustrating variance 7/ Learning curve in PLO,poker,"Part 7 of simulating the careers of 50 poker players who play at least a million hands. So far we have simulated changes in bankroll strategy, differences between PLO and NL (by increasing standard deviation) and increased the hands played all the way up to 55 million hands to give all players a chance to overcome the variance impact on an aggressive bankroll strategy. All players have a positive win rate and none of them tilt so differences in results are just variance. In part 6 we looked a bit deeper at bankroll management to demonstrate that an aggressive bankroll strategy (move up/down at 20bi) sucks in PLO because you struggle to overcome negative variance in $ terms. We tried 40bi and that was ok but 100bi was better at the cost of a reduction in winnings. Link to [Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jyencp/illustrating_variance_6_bankroll_management/)

So now we start to play with win rates by way of a learning curve. Instead of $2nl being 9bb/100 reducing by 1bb/100 for each stake until 100nl then reducing by 0.5bb/100 until you get a win rate of 1bb/100 at 10knl, we start each new stake level (either up or down) at 1bb/100 and that win rate increases by 0.66bb/100 for every 10k hands spent at that stake. This is closer to real life after all. The figures were chosen so that the EV comes out the same as it did in part 6 \~$11k

Change in output graph too. EV is on the left. Notes:

1. 100bi to move up stakes was enough with the higher low stakes win rates to over come variance enough that we saw plenty of people above EV. Noting that with the normal distribution we would expect half the players to be above EV. However, now, no-one is above EV.  
2. I did a large run with 150 players and still no-one got above $8.6k end bankroll. The message should be really clear: PLO variance is so high that even cautious BR management (100bi to move up) isn't enough with win rates are low. Here we lower win rates and that simply prohibits anyone getting above EV in $ terms. 
3. Compare player 9 with player 42. Player 9's bankroll is &gt; $4k ending at 25PLO with a 5.6bb/100 win rate but poor old player 42 ends at PLO25 with a 8.3bb/100 win rate (indicating he's been there longer) but less than $3.5k bankroll.  
4. Player 10 has a shit experience. EV is a bankroll of &gt;$10k but this guy ends with $477 playing $2plo and having re-bought 7 times ($20 a pop). Odds he thinks online is rigged?

If you play PLO get really good and have a big bankroll. Next I'll repeat this but back to NL and from there we can experiment with other bankroll strategies unless anyone has better ideas. It's mostly NL players here after all.

For a laugh, I ran the learning curve sim with 20bi BR management. OMFG. Just a million hands but EV gets to $1,206,437 bankroll playing $10kplo with a win rate of 11.6bb/100 because he's been there so long. The highest of bankroll of the 50 players? $1,685 playing $50plo. So I ran it again for 350 players, looking for an outlier and out of 350 players, one player makes a bankroll of $3,107,107, no-one else gets above $20k. 

I must have crawled through the code (there's &lt;50 active lines) 30 times now hoping to find a bug that might explain how much variance interacts with an aggressive BR management strategy to make you run bad and I can't find one. So despite so many players running bad in $ terms, like unavoidably bad, I can't help but conclude the model is right and this is the world we play in.",1606243848

1. Preflop play: Min raise seemed weak, so I didn't put much stock in people calling. From EP, this seemed like a good opportunity to try and 4! to take down the pot with a decent hand w/ nut potential.
2. Flop raise: Villain was short stacked and seemed passive. I figured the flop bet was either a weak attempt to bluff me off with air or something to bait me into betting into him. Obviously it was the latter.

folds around to the guy on my right who is the button. he limps. i complete the small blind with J7spades, BB checks. blinds 30/60

flop comes AJJ, i am first to act, i check and it checks around.

Turn brings the 7 of clubs, now 2 clubs o the board. I check hoping someone gets brave and the button bets 60. i call, so does BB.

River comes 8 of clubs, completing backdoor flush and straight draws. I lead out for 300 hoping for anyone of these backdoors getting there.

BB folds and river raises 300. ofc you prob know where this is going. i think about how its pretty impossible for him to have AJ, so i raise all in as he has 900 behind and sure enough get the bad news. (he has the AJ ofc)

so should i never ever ever go for the re-raise with this type of hand ever?

a little later i saw a dude flat call a reraise on the river with the  KJ full house on a JJ6KQ board on a non preflop raised hand. it made me think of this prev hand i was in. his opponent would have had to have a very specific hand to beat him, his opponent had 66, so he could have easily felted the 6's

so it has me thinking, should i never be going for ""value"" with a hand like this ever again or is this the 1 in a million loss that nets me a profit in the long wrong with this re-raise in this spot every time?",1606178696

7991,$2/$3 Hand Analysis (2 hands),poker,"Playing 8 handed with about 110 BBs in my stack (up about 43 BBs after an hour). Getting a little impatient and Hero opens UTG to $10 with AdTc. Villain with a similar stack size at UTG+1 raises to $17 (I don’t know how this is even a min raise, first time playing in California and I didn’t ask questions). Folds around and Hero calls. Flop comes AsKc3d. Hero checks, Villain checks. Turn is 8c. Hero bets $15, Villain raises to $30. Hero calls. River is 7s. Hero checks, Villain bets $35. Hero is dumb and makes the call, Villain shows AQ. Is ATo always a fold-pre UTG playing 8 handed? Besides calling river, what other mistakes were made?


Second hand: UTG opens to $10, 1 caller, Hero in the SB raises to $40 with JJ and both players call. Flop comes KQ3 rainbow. Hero checks, both other players check. Turn is 9 to complete rainbow. Hero checks again thinking afraid he’s being trapped - both other players check again. River is an 8 - Hero checks a third time and to his surprise both other players check and JJ takes it down.

OTTH: I have K8o and limp, he makes it 100, i call. 

flop is AK8. He bets 200 with A3. 

Knowing that he's inelastic and he will always call here, is calling a better play than getting it in and letting equity run out? I just jammed and he snap called and turned an A. If i just call the 200 i can probably fold when he barrels the turn huge.

Would the pot odds be 7:1 or 8:1? Am I supposed to add the $1 bet into the total pot (making the pot $8) or not count that $1 bet (making the pot $7)? 

The reason I am so confused is because I found another example on upswing that is saying the way to properly calculate the odds is to add the pot size+the bet size+the call size. As opposed to the poker stars example which is saying just to add the pot size to villains bet size. 

So basically if I go by upswings rule the pot odds for that practice problem would be 8:1 but if I go by pokerstars rule the pot odds would be 7:1. Can someone help clarify this for me?",1606169322

8001,Turning Bottom 2 into a bluff after facing aggression from two tricky players? Live 2-5,poker,"Hero opens QhTh to 20 in the cutoff, SB and BB both call.  BB is a pretty tight caller preflop, but not afraid to get aggro or bluff aggressively postflop.  BB is also not afraid to go for thin value, and he's decent enough at hand reading. 
 SB is very aggro postflop.  We are 1500 effective with both players.

(55)  Flop is KcQcTs.  Checks to me, I bet 35, SB raises to 120, BB cold calls.  SB can be aggressive without the nuts, and I suspect BB knows this, so I call as well.

(415). Turn is 4d, SB checks, BB bets 265.  I think he 3bets AJs, but AJo and J9s are possible, as well as at least some other 2pair combos.  I've seen him flat sometimes with TT preflop.  Not sure if he can turn QJ or JT into a bluff here, but maybe?  Clubs is also definitely possible.  I call, SB folds.

(945). River 3c, so clubs gets there. BB bets 350.  We have about 1110 left.  To me, this reeks of a hand that doesn't want to get it all in, but does want some value from my likely holdings.  I think V is going to discount me from having sets here since I never put in a raise earlier, and might be doing this with TT or two pairs for value / blocker bets. I'm not sure if he ever does this with the actual flush to induce a raise.

What should hero do here?

Call?  Maybe I'm beating QJ or JT?

Fold?  He's got a lot of hands that are beating me here.

Bluff raise all in?  If he's going for some thin value with a value hand on the flop, I think I can get him off anything less than the nut straight.",1606161909

I know that situations like this are incredibly rare, but I feel like it's super important to get right since a fuck ton of money is about to be in this pot. Is there an ""optimal"" play? Cold calling seems so strong that getting money on later streets is unlikely, but you're not supposed to raise the nuts, right? It seems like he's repping a straight or a set almost 100%, both of which are likely calling a jam.

8044,Best city to play live AND online in Europe?,poker,"Hello guys.

I've been playing since childhood, then in my adulthood played private live games and online poker (at pokerstars). Since 2015 I wasn't playing at all (it's just stop being fun for me), but something about 2 months ago I've took part in private live game again and oh boy, it was a lot of fun for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately in my country poker is treated as illegal gambling (both: online and private if you are playing for cash) and poker at official casinos sucks AF - not many players, then really high taxes etc. There is also very small number of official casinos in entire country.

Basically everyone are playing private games, but playing there also involving sometimes the dealing with people which you don't really wan't to know (sometimes even people which you don't want to win with) etc., so it's not a solution too.

&amp;#x200B;

Money is not a problem at all, I have a nice bankroll, savings for living and still making nice money working remotely. I've thought about moving to another European country to play, but I don't know where. 

The thing is I want to play online everyday (or every other day) and 2 days in a week the live poker in the casino, but sometimes probably I'll want to play only live games in the week as I'm enjoying it a way more than online. Depend's from the mood. 

Now the question:  which country in Europe would be the best for this purpose? I thought about Prague in Czech Republic, is it good to move there? Maybe some another recommendations?

-Flop comes K9Q rainbow. I lead out for $3.50, the villain attempts to raise to $6, then is told by the dealer min raise would be $7. I call the $7. 

-Turn comes another king. Board is now K9QK I check, as I usually would after being raised on the flop. Villain beats $6.50, I raise to $20.50, villain shoves for roughly $60. This is a couple hands after I beat this player full house over full house, anyways I make the call and villain shows KK for quads. 

After writing this out and thinking about the hand more I don’t think I’m ever good in this situation. Losing to quad kings makes this less worse IMO but I should still be folding bc of hands like KQ or K9s which would theoretically just call my UTG open. I think my first mistake is raising the turn, after getting raised on the flop. Following his 3-bet jam I have to think what hands am I really beating as I think he would never be bluffing here which would only be pocket 9’s but I still lose to KK, KQ, and K9 which should pretty much be a snap fold in hindsight. I have trouble folding premium hands like AA, KK, QQ even when the board may not be favorable.

I feel like im running worse than ive ever run, not sure how reliable it is but my luck factor in gg was noluck, kinda feels like its true but i do not want to dismiss all the big pots i lose as coolers so i want to know if im doing some things wrong.

1) How often should i c-bet small flop, bet big on turns in 3-bet/4bet pot, too often the flop comes low cards, i bet small V call, a good card for me to barrel (A,K,Q) comes on the turn and villian just shoves in my face.

2) How do i play overpairs both IP and OOP on the flop in a 3 bet pot specifically (99-JJ) as the 3 bet caller. i find it hard to play these spots and im not sure which is more profitable. Calling and then seeing a overcard peel just makes it so hard to call the turn. Raising to deny equity from 2 overs seem decent but puts me in a tough spot when V 3 bets me especially when there are flush/straight draws, i find myself going broke here to a bigger overpair a lot.

3) How do i play top pair, decent kicker OOP.  Do i passively check call 3 street? Should i call again on the turn if an overcard hit and im facing a big bet? Feels like im bleeding money here alot as well when i check call, check fold on lots of turn or check raise then have to see a overcard come and makes my turn and river decision super hard to play.",1606073079

8094,Standard exploit turn folds or too tight?,poker,"1/3NL, 7-handed

**Hand 1: top pair vs. turn check-raise**

Preflop: HJ limps, I raise to $15 in the CO with KsJx, BB (young rec-whale) calls, LJ calls.

Flop (\~$40): J44r, one spade. BB donks $10 (does this all the time), LJ calls, I call.

Turn (\~$70): 7s bringing a flush draw. BB checks, HJ checks, I bet $20. BB folds, HJ raises to $60, I fold.

There aren't many credible monsters for the LJ limp-caller, but there aren't really any bluffs unless LJ somehow floated the donk bet with just a bdfd (I guess it's possible since it was a tiny bet and it's 1/3, but I didn't see LJ as that loose and I also have the Ks) The problem is, this reasoning applies to basically every hand I could have except JJ and a 77 that I raise pre and overcall, so this seems highly exploitable.

**Hand 2: Fold JJ vs. single bet**

Preflop: $6 straddle on. I open to $25 in MP with JxJc, only BB calls.

Flop (\~$50): KcQc8x. BB checks, I check.

Turn: offsuit 7. BB bets $25, I fold.

BB plays too loose and has definitely been on the aggro side but I block virtually all of the obvious bluffs so otherwise this would be an obvious fold. Fold this or call once and fold the river?",1606027138
8095,"PT4 or HM3 (for database analysis,not so interested in HUD)?",poker,"Hi,I have PT4 small stakes right now.Played few tourneys that are not tracked in my current version.

Question is,PT4 upgrade to the full version?or HM3 full version (purchase from scratch)?

Playing at the moment mostly NL10, up to NL25.But few tournaments as mention with higher BI,and probably playing above NL25 by next year

Which one of the both are better to analyse hands with ease? I like PT4,but sometimes to filter specific spots can be a bit of not so intuitive to figure out.

Is it the same in HM3?(ie,filtering hands like X position vs Y position,facing triple barrels in 3BP from exactly X position,etc etc)

Not using HUD as much,but yes using population filters to analyse database,so basically looking to change to HM3 if UI for filtering spots is easier than in PT4,or to just upgrade if it is not that much of a difference.

I originally got PT4 because I saw somewhere that it was better on low specs laptops than HM2,but got a better PC now so running any of them smoothly should not be an issue.

8096,[1/3NL live] Line check: flop check/shove in 3b pot,poker,"1/3NL live, 8-handed

Preflop: Young rec-whale opens UTG to $7 (has been playing every hand and mixing this raise and limping). 2 loose regs call from late position; I 3bet from BB to $30 with A?Qd, only UTG calls.

Flop (\~$70): 5d3d2x. I check, UTG (who has also been way overbluffing postflop) bets $50, I shove for \~$240 effective.

\--

I realized immediately that the preflop squeeze is too small ($45ish looks better?).

On this flop, I have a much stronger range than this guy, but for some reason I felt like he would float me very wide and I wasn't sure what I'd do on the turn. I figured he'd bet for sure if checked to so I essentially let him act first.

Once I face a large-ish bet, I'm not in love with just calling from out of position since it seems too likely that I'll have to fold on a lot of turns. Even though my hand is likely best, it's actually one of my weaker hands as my BB squeezes in these spots are pretty tight (e.g. AQ+/99+ with some of the strongest remaining suited hands; not sure if this should be wider).

With the gutter + backdoor equity + probably pair outs, this becomes a ""value-shove"" (which I could also make with some overpairs) to deny equity from my opponent's garbage but probably doesn't actually fold out anything better. The sizing seems a bit ridiculous but I don't think there's other options for raising as anything else leaves barely any money behind for the turn.

8142,Illustrating variance 6/ bankroll management,poker,"Part 6 of simulating the careers of 50 poker players who play 1 million hands. All players have a win rate at all stake levels from $2 buy-in all the way up to $10,000 buy-in. Everyone starts at the $2 buy-in level with $20 (10 buy-ins) and moves up or down stakes at 20 buy-ins. Win rates drop and standard deviations rise as stakes increase. None of these players tilt so the difference in results is literally just variance. In part 5 we looked a bit deeper at the underlying normal distribution to check that it is changing stakes that causes it to take a shit ton of hands to overcome any material negative variance. It cost one poster his left nut. Link to part 5: [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jydre1/illustrating_variance_5_normal_distributions/) 

Now we can look at bankroll management. Holding a higher buy-in requirement to move up in stakes will reduce your lifetime winnings simply because you'll hang around lower stakes for longer, all other things being equal. It does mean, though, that you run less risk of variance forcing you to move down in stakes with the upside that you're at higher stakes if you run good. This should be pretty simple logic, losing all your 80% all-ins at $200nl will suck but then to win all your 20% all-ins at $2nl will suck more since your luck has evened out (assuming this is the only variance you see) but you don't have much money.

Also, in line with the conclusions from part 5, a higher buy-in requirement we expect to see more players above EV over 1 million hands with a higher bankroll requirement to move up.

And .. that's what we see. At a 40bi requirement, the number of players above EV in $ terms goes from 3 to 6. At 100bi, the number of players goes from 3 to 12. The flip side, though, is a big reduction in EV. With a 40bi bankroll requirement, EV drops from $448,455 to $101,081 which is quite the trade-off. With a 100bi requirement EV drops all the way to $11,092 playing PLO100. On the plus side, again, everyone is PLO10 and only 2 players are there with most at PLO25 or higher. 

In summary, a bigger bankroll requirement gives what you want from it: A reduced risk of busto, a slower but steadier rise through the stakes, more change to achieve EV neutral and these come at the cost of total expected winnings.

None of these players tilt so the difference in results is literally just variance. In part 4 we looked a bit deeper into PLO to see how many hands were needed for all players to get to high stakes. It's a lot. Link to part 4: [Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jxv1gz/illustrating_variance_4_plo_part_2/)

The sims have raised a number of queries about the distribution of results. The underlying distribution  is the normal distribution, the one that produces a bell shaped curve. The center point is the mean result and the standard deviation describes whether it's a flatter hump (high std dev causing more extreme results, i.e. further away from the mean to be more likely) or a more pointy one (low std dev). Apologies to maths pros but not everyone gets this. I'm not trying to be patronising or assuming everyone gets this stuff.

Just looking at a normal distribution of results would suggest we see equal number of players with $ results above the EV result as we do below the EV result. This isn't what the sims show, hence the confusion. I have suggested this is because EV losses at higher stakes cost more money introducing a material delay effect on the normalisation of $ results compared to bb results. In part, this is what parts 3 and 4 show when taken together. At 1 million hands only 3 players were above EV, at 20 million hands the number was 6 and at 55 million hands there were 13 players above EV. The discussion got a little tense with one poster betting his left nut on the distribution not being normal.

To draw out whether the cause of this delay is changing stakes, I have run a sim without the ability to move up. If I'm right, with only 1 million hands run, we should see roughly half of the players above EV, like we expect from a normal distribution. If I'm wrong then the chart will look like the 1 million hand sim in part 3 with only 3 players above EV. The RNG in C++ is psuedo-random, using a list of values, which means results can be replicated.

Here is the chart. If you've been gambling with your nuts, I have some bad news:

The fat, bright red line running up the middle is the EV line. 22 players are above EV, which is perfectly reasonable for the normal distribution.

Regards bankroll management, I've always used it solely as a mechanism to stay in the game since I ain't bothered about moving down and just want to avoid busto. But if your ego is so insulted about moving down in stakes that doing so is a form of death then moving up at 20 buy-ins is not going to cut it. Next post will look at the effect of bigger bankroll requirements. I predict more players will end up above EV in $ terms as a result.",1605976698

8151,Overfolding Spots 25NL,poker,"Hey all. I'm around 6BB/100 winner at 10NLz, moved up to 25NLz on Stars and got absolutely creamed for around -15BB/100 over 20k hands. The biggest weakness I've managed to locate is that I simply cannot get away from hands enough, no matter how many times I tell myself that the 25NL regs don't have bluffing ranges. Pretty much any time I call all-in with anything other than the stone cold ones I'm beat. I'm trying to compile a list of more specific spots where I can overfold profitably so that I have something tangible to go on, rather than just ""fold a lot"". Any help would be lovely!

So far I have:

TPTK vs triple barrels

8155,Study strategy (not resource recs) for GTO?,poker,"Hi r/poker,

I recently read Ed Miller's 1% book and it's helped my game tremendously. I struggle with impatience and spew and this approach helps me stay within myself.

I'd like to get more focused and serious about my study, and I'm having a hard time finding a good framework. Miller's advice to just work out the top 70% of hands on different boards has been a good start, and now I'm becoming aware of how different solver-approved frequencies can be in different spots (much more or less than 70%). Between that and a few other things I was hoping y'all could suggest something a little more nuanced than just 70% over and over again.

I'd like to avoid buying a solver if possible but if there's no getting around it I could probably take a deep breath and pull the trigger.

I'm especially interested in any first-hand stories from people who have implemented gto in their games. How did you do it? If you had it to do over again, what would you do now?

Thanks for your time and good luck in your games.",1605963445

I’m really not sure that there are any bluffs in his range with this sizing as it gives such a great price to call; but also wouldn’t a strong value hand want to have a little more protection, especially calling the flop with someone left to act behind him? Against this value range we have around 31% equity, and have more than the correct odds to call, and maybe that’s how the hand should have been played. We also only need V to fold 24% of the time to be profitable. In the end I’m not sure if this is a punt or not.

8197,my poker journey,poker,"My first real taste of poker came in grade 10.  I was maybe fifteen, sixteen at the time, and we organized a five card draw game during second period spare.  Eventually we got busted by the teachers.  I was eighteen when the poker boom hit.  My friends and I played $5 SNGs and WPT Tournaments were a big deal on TV.  Then a .10/.25 NLHE home game (some nights .25/.50). This game was classic. Actually I played a rather effective loose aggro style at the time. Well I would switch gears, a bit looser early on, some bluffs, and then straight value towards the end of the night. Really we didn't know anything, but we the great thing about poker is you only have to be slightly better than your opponents.  


There was a raked 1/2 game in my town, the Rounders Club or something they called themselves, that I cut my eyeteeth on. Then casino trips. I remember sitting down at a 5/10 limit hold'em game.  This was so long ago people actually played limit hold'em.   


One day there was a tournament in town, someone had rented a warehouse and set up a tournament.  I busted in the tournament with an underpair to the top pair, but with the $200 I had left in my pockets I cleaned up on the cash game, playing 1/2 with a bunch of degenerate cabbies. I'd swing crazy amounts online.  I was still in high school the first time I ran up a tiny amount of money to three grand on pokerstars, before losing it all quickly. I was fairly degenerate at that age, but we were young and invincible. I went broke a bunch of times, and then scraped together a bankroll and grinded online.   


At one point I moved to Niagara Falls to try my hand at live poker.  It went pretty decently for a couple of months. It was full ring NLHE, and the games were very soft, filled with rich tourists. I was living in a nearby hotel and grinding the casino all day. One day I tried my hand at blackjack and lost almost ten grand.  I had a ton of cash on me, from all my poker winnings, and I started degening on blackjack for a while.  I ran pretty good and had a stash of 5k chips.  Then I started losing a bunch of my profits back. That is when I learned about card counting online.  With my history at the casino as a whale, I was able to count full time in the high limit room for about ten days straight. And any time the count started to drop I would just hop  to another table.  There was always a new deck, ready to go.  So I played A TON of rounds.  And my poker career had steeled me not to hit and run.  And I play very fast.  The result was a huge winning streak. I was using a fairly aggressive spread, 1 to 16 on black.  By the time they banned me I had around $200,000.  Paranoid, I spent that night in a hotel.

From that point I was backed off, so I travelled Canada playing blackjacked, getting backed off and banned with my high stakes action.

8201,Here are some sad truths about poker,poker,[removed],1605899196
8202,Illustrating variance 4/ PLO part 2,poker,"Part 4 of simulating the careers of 50 poker players who play 1 million hands. All players have a win rate at all stake levels from $2 buy-in all the way up to $10,000 buy-in. Everyone starts at the $2 buy-in level with $20 (10 buy-ins) and moves up or down stakes at 20 buy-ins. Win rates drop and standard deviations rise as stakes increase. None of these players tilt so the difference in results is literally just variance. In part 3 we took a first look by using the NL model and bumping the standard deviation to simulate PLO and we allowed rebuys to stop people going broke. Confirmed PLO is sick. Link: [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jwn8pp/illustrating_variance_3_plo_edition/)

A poster asked: Can you model 5 million hands and 10 million hands? Is there a number of hands at which everyone gets to high stakes? Erm, yes, yes and yes. The model is pretty darn quick. People struggle with long posts so I won't post the intermediate graphs \\ data and will just post the end point: Everyone reached 10knl at some point in their career if they played 20 million hands. 

Notes:

1. Every single player, at some point, is up over $200,000 which is the threshold for the $10,000 buy-in games. Player 1, who ends with only $236, was up $3,037,580 at one point. Player 27, who ends the 20 million hand career with a whopping $294, was up $2,522,910 at the 16.4 million hand mark and was back below $2,000 within 1.2 million hands. He got several hundred thousand up and then visited 2plo twice over 20 million hands. 
2. Many more players are above EV at the 20 million hand mark. I was a little worried about the low numbers of players above EV since, intuitively, I would expect even numbers of players above or below EV but it doesn't work like that in this model. Each session is 100 hands. Very rarely, but reasonably often given how many sessions are in the data set, a player will win or lose something like 15 buy-ins in one session. This can knock you down several stake levels because losing $15k from a $20k bankroll playing the $1,000 buy-in games bumps you down to $5k bankroll playing the $200 buy-in games. However, a 15 buy-in winning session from a $5k bankroll playing the $200 buy-in games only puts your bankroll at $8k and you're still playing $200 buy-in games!! A negative variance event hurts you, in $ terms, way more than a positive event boosts you. This is why so few players are above EV in $ terms after so many millions of hands. 
3. If the model simulated, and adjusted stakes, on a hand by hand basis we could probably get more players above EV. This gives us an important strategy point. Be more willing to move down than move up. You can't predict that a session that started shit will continue shit so this strategy advice is nothing to do with continuing variance. It is everything to do with being human. If a session starts really shitty, it's a rare person who is completely unaffected and continues to play their best. You can't afford any erosion of win rate from playing anything other than your absolute best. So, for safety's sake, move down the instant you're off your a-game. Variance will screw you over enough without you adding any more risk.
4. Remember 20 million hands is just another arbitrary cut-off point. The fact that many players are in the micros at this point isn't a particularly relevant fact. This is just the earliest (roughly) where everyone had got up to the $10k games at least once.

Unless anyone comes up with anything super interesting, next I'm going to look reducing the standard deviations a bit. I'm pretty convinced they are too high so I think I'll start NL at 80, and increment by 2 per stake level (rather than 5). Note that I'm open to keeping these high standard deviations if someone has data to show that $10knl has a standard deviation of 135. This should give more comfort that we're not wasting our time, well those of us who've run bad at least, because variance will have less of an effect. 

After that I'm going to have a crack at simulating a learning curve. Everyone will start at a 1bb/100 win rate (or something) when they first play a new stake level (moving up or down) but that will increase for every 10k (or 5k hands, not sure) hands they play at those stakes. These two will, hopefully, start to get this really close to reality (minus tilt which I'm not sure about simulating).",1605898422
8203,How to play flop/turn/river with a premium and you hit hard on a dry board?,poker,"in both situations of when you're IP or OOP, when you get a premium and hit the flop on a dry board (i.e. AK, board comes A38 rainbow. or AK4 rainbow, etc) how do you navigate this?

Majority of the time, if you are IP, it will be checked to you as the PFR. i find that if I bet out small, its hard to extract value in your favor. and if you bet to big, everyone will fold. if you check everyone is happy, and the turn leads to nothing.

8215,Playing in the different stakes,poker,I’ve found that playing in 1/2 1/3 games that if I’m to win decent in those stakes I usually have to play conservative and play my good hands pretty straight up. A lot of people don’t really bluff much at those tables and they’re calling machines and will call you down with a pair or two making them a lot harder to bluff. It makes getting value easy but as they say you must bluff to be a winning player and I find I just get called down at these stakes all the time. I started playing 2/5 and my success in these stakes is insane compared to lower stakes and I find my strategy working much much better against smarter thinking players.

8262,Dealer Error(s) Cost me $2800 in live 2/5 PLO game hand....,poker,"I was playing in a 2/5 PLO game recently and a dealer Error Cost me $2,800. 

Hand. I have KKxx on a $10 straddle (I cover all stacks). There is a bunch of limpers and I pot to $70.
3 callers.

4 ways to a flop (~$240) flop is KhJh5. I lead out $200. And player to my left raises to $525. Everyone folds and I easily repot to $1300ish to put the player all in (he started hand with around $1300). There is some banter at the table and the dealer is talking away. The dealer tosses out the ""call token"" to the other player. I only run once so didn't instigate running twice or anything. As normal, dealer runs out the turn and river. They are total bricks (7,2) and KK is the nuts on the river. I am psyched and about to turn my hand over and the all in player starts asking ""what happened""....?  What's going on?""

Apparently he never said call, nobody heard him say call, he didn't notice the call token thrown near his stack, and he didn't even know I had raised. 

I sort of give the player the benefit of the doubt here since I don't put him as the kind of angling player (although still possible). 

Dealer said they made a mistake and thought player called. Floor gets called, and they can't confirm if player called. Nobody heard him say call. He didn't signal a call in any way. Floor says move the turn and river to the side and deal a new turn/river if player calls - action is back on player. 

He then says ""okay I was always going to call, call"" 

I protest at this point saying how can the dealer make such a mistake, and I asked floor for the initial cards to be shuffled back in the deck (it helps out the other players hand for instance for 2 bricks being taken out). Without a discussion being finalized, the dealer just all of the sudden runs the board out completing opponents flush and he wins. 

I protest saying the turn and river should be shuffled back in the deck, and it turns out that was the official rules at the cardroom. The floor then says the runout has already been complete and it was ""dealer Error"" to not put the cards back in the deck looooool, even though the floor asked dealer to put the cards to the side. 

Major screwup cost me $2800. I've never seen such incompetence. Just to be clear, if the dealer wasn't screwing around chatting about football with the other players maybe they would be paying attention to the hand in the first place. 

Lesson - NEVER assume the dealers are competent. If in a giant hand, get everything verbalized before cards are run, even if they throw the damn call token at someone.

Another example, I have 33 on a K 5 2 rainbow board and my opponent check raised me on this flop, then he is less likely on a straight draw because I block 34, A3, 36??

Final example, I have JJ and the flop is Q 7 2 rainbow, I bet and the opponent calls. The turn is another Q then my opponent is less likely to have a Q??  I keep barreling the turn and get re-raised??

8291,"Profitability of ""double-up"" and ""triple-up"" SNG's",poker,"Since the start of the pandemic, I've been playing more sit-and-go's than ever before in my life. I'm not the strongest cash game player but I do fairly well in tournaments, so the SNG is the source of most of my online profits.

While they are not ""new"", it seems like recently more sites are offering ""double-up"" and ""triple-up"" SNG's in which the game is either six or nine handed but places 1, 2, and 3 all pay the same prize (either double or triple your buy-in). At first I sort of snubbed these, but over the past month or so they have been extremely profitable for me, and I wanted to get some opinions on my logic here and possibly start a discussion about this format in general.

**First point: Time is money**

A huge positive for this format is the time investment. Since play only continues until three players are left and then immediately ends, the average double/triple-up SNG only lasts about 15-20 minutes. Compare this to a normal SNG where it can take up to an hour, much of which is often heads-up play. The faster format allows for more games per session, and helps to maintain focus. Theoretically you can play 2-3 games of this format in the same time you could play a single normal SNG. Obviously if you're multi-tabling anyway then this is not a huge factor, but it's worth mentioning.

**Second point: Reduced variance**

Since the final three get paid the same no matter what, it only matters that you make the final three. It does not matter what your chip count is or how big of a lead you may have. Since luck is always a factor in poker, shifting the goal post from ""I must win outright to maximize profits"" to ""I just need to make the final three"" allows for more aggressive play in certain spots and also provides a safety net in the event of a misplay or cooler situation. It's still important to gain and maintain a chip lead, but losing 2/3 of your stack on the bubble is not quite the heartbreaker it is in normal SNG's. 

**Third point: Skill specialization**

I'll come right out and say it: I am not a phenomenal heads-up player. I do okay, but I would not consider that my strong point. I can't tell you the number of times I've had a large chip lead going into heads-up in a SNG only to bleed it away over the next 20-30 hands. This format eliminates that possibility entirely, with the trade-off of capping winnings below what they would be for first place in a normal SNG. For players like me who perform their strongest in the early/mid stages of most tournaments, this format really plays into those strengths.

**Conclusion**

For some players (myself included), I feel that the double/triple-up SNG provides a consistent way to profit with minimal effort or time invested on a per-game basis. I've taken to thinking about it like a tortoise-and-hare type situation - slow and steady gains for consistent profit with far fewer swings than one might normally expect.

I'm assuming games are much less soft these days - is that generally accurate? I really preferred HU SNGs once I got my feet under me - it seems those games are rare/the hardest these days, is that generally accurate? What are some of the biggest adjustments someone like me might want to consider making? 

I realize this is a rather vague set of questions. I'm just looking for some discussion in the hopes of reorienting myself before jumping back in. I won't be putting in millions of hands or looking to make an income, mostly just looking to consistently beat some low-mid stakes SNGs, either HU, short or full tables (in order of preference I guess).",1605795522

8309,Best software to become semipro (+poker evolution background story),poker,"Hello, I'm on my way for becoming a semipro. If you are interested just in the software questions you can find it at the bottom of this post.

Some background.
More than 10 years ago, I used to play poker online as a hobby. I was able to beat the micros up to NL 10, but after some months my winrate after rake became negative and I lost the bankroll I generated of over 1000€. It was a slow and bleeding downfall. I now understand that without using a HUD and without learning any theory I became an easy target to exlote by regulars as I had for sure many leaks, especially with my LAG strategy. I stopped playing.

I started again 2,5 months ago in NL2 and I have been improving a lot because this time I'm using a HUD (HM3 because I got for  free the license after playing in 888) and learning the theory. It's going well and I have increased to NL20. My bankroll is still just under 600€ although I know that I have been aggressive escalating before until now but my expectation is to playing NL 10/20 for months. 

I risked bankroll in exchange to start learning better meta game and learning faster. Anyway my bet is going well, as my winrate in NL20 has been 22bb/100 with only 5k hands played. Variance is helping me for sure, but I played my best poker in higher stakes as I respected much more my opponents, understood them better and didn't tilt when losing. Getting tilt has been a significant issue especially because when I had lesser knowledge, as I didn't know how to play, I had more room to become maniac. I'm very surprised that after getting tilted several times in these months, I still got a positive bankroll. And I'm learning to accept my loses as part of the game.

I wanted to add that I feel I could be more aggressive with my bankroll than recommended because  I generated additional 900€ bankroll in the betting sites in las 3 months (not because Im expert in sport odds but just using basic stats and taking advantage of all promo offers for free bets). So I play as my bankroll combined is 1500€ together. Anyway I have never been more than€20 net negative in poker overall at the beginning.

My goal is reaching NL100 in 6-12 months investing 4-6 hours a day. 50% time invested in studying (right now watching video courses in poker and studying my HUD database).  

SOFTWARE

Well, I want to keep improving and I would like to leverage your experience. What software I need to keep growing? 
1- Should I start using a piosolver to keep improving? Is there any non-expensive option that is good enough? Maybe is it too early for a piosolver?

2- I feel that I need a program to manage several tables at the same time. Right now I usually play 2-4 tablds at the same time depending of the concentration I need to feel I'm playing good enough. Probably I could increase the number but I'd need software help. I tried table ninja 2 but it didn't work with 888 and partypoker which are my current platforms (betfair poker is my 3rd one, but lately I rarely use it).

3- any recommendation for a hotkey software. I have seen that some poker youtubers use it. A cheap one?

4- do I need something like Flopzilla? I was about to pay for a license but I wanted to ask your opinion before doing so.

5- Am I missing anything?

Ps, overall feedback about my strategy is also appreciated

8317,Call or raise at 500nl when your opponent reps little,poker,"Played at 500nl on BetMgm (NJ Pool). V is reg- like most NJ regs, pretty nitty. 

V opens CO to $12.5

H calls from BB with Ah Jd

Turn comes a 5 of spades, bringing 2 spades. Action goes check check

River comes another 9 but doesn't bring in the flush. H checks, V bets 1/3 $9.5

Obviously this isnt a huge pot or anything ground breaking blocker wise- but what exactly is V repping? Any value should be betting flop (A9, TT+, sets). We beat enough bluffs but if he's randomly turning some AQ/AK type hand into a bluff then calling doesn't seem so good. Can V ever have a nutted hand (99, 77, 66, 97s, 88) when he takes this line?

8346,Learning and Coaching,poker,"Hey guys, I'm interested in learning poker but don't really know where to start. I will start this thread by explaining my interest in it.

As many of you have you gained an interest through it by watching tv. It is the same for me. It all started at a christmas party god knows how many years ago. Me and a family member where watching poker and discussing it (I forget the conversation). I thought, It would be cool to learn that, but it doesn't seem as easy as it looks (It looked like they just took the best parts, kind of like nba or nfl highlights). So now this is my position now. I'm 16 years old with a lot, and I mean a lot of time on my hands. I plan on getting my first job soon so that is nice as well (it won't take up an insane amount of my time)

I'm interested in learning but I am coming from a position where I know pretty much nothing at all. I intend on mastering the basics (in every other skill I have attempted when i didn't master the basics I failed). I am also interested in reaching an intermediate or possibly pro level over time. Right now I will just treat it as a hobby (if I get really good I might take of a year to see if going pro is for me).

What resources should I be using to learn (I really don't have a budget and could spend a generally high amount but not an absolutely insane amount to where it is out of reason, like getting trained by daniel negreanu irl). I am also based in the north jersey area if that helps with assisting me where to get coaching (may be hard under the current situation the entire world is in tho)

All in all to get through this rant I would like to reach an intermediate to advanced level in poker, but have little to no idea where to start, and a common issue that I have when learning new things is that when I know where to start I have trouble finding the next step, so learning structure would almost be a must

8347,Illustrating variance 3/ PLO edition,poker,"PLO is swingy. First up is a straight repeat of the NL sim just increasing the variance (by 50 for each stake level so starting at 130 end up at 185 - again, might be too high) but still allowing busto. Link to post 2: [Illustrating variance 2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jwjttk/illustrating_variance_2/)

Notes:

1. EV is still $448,455 because nothing in win rates has changed.
2. Player 2 starts with $20, sinks as low as $9, peaks at $780,735 but ends the 1 million hand sample at $19,501. Without tilt affecting his win rate. OMG. It's a common pattern. Player 10 peaks at $291,329, ends at $1,860. Player 28 peaks at  $770,778 but ends at just $1,838.
3. 18 players go broke. 3 players manage to exceed EV at some point but at the 1 million hand mark, none of them had held onto it.

So we allow rebuys. Seems vital! Notes

1. Our big winner, player 35, had a low of just $5. Never give up! That $5 got spun into $1,856,420.
2. Player 20 had a good recovery. 4 rebuys but still got to $24,602 by the end. Honestly, poker media would hold that up as an example of stoic play, never letting the swings get you down but none of these players tilt. All maintain their win rates no matter what. It's just variance doing its thing.
3. A couple of players never bust but never get going. Players 3, 22, 23, 31 and 36 end playing PLO10 despite never rebuying. Their peaks were $28,600, $12,618, $5,953, $72,576 and $5,084 respectively. Literally: Withdrawing 'winnings' from PLO is pointless. You'll end up putting it back on to maintain stakes you've been beating. Player 31 peaked at $72,576 for fuck's sake before losing all the way down to $416 at the million hand mark. Note, again, that the standard deviations might be too high.

I think I've covered the various scenarios requested yesterday. Anyone got anymore? Might be worth trying out some lower standard deviations. I have seen JNandez87 data for stakes around 500PLO and his standard deviation seemed really low, in context, at 120.

Also, I ended up posting the corrected code in a reply so if anyone wants to replicate this or find errors you can do so. Visual Studio is free, create a new console app and copy in the code. I'm self-taught though so for all you real programmers out there, erm, sorry?",1605729932

8361,Illustrating variance 2/,poker,"This could turn into a series if there's enough engagement on things to look at. Theme is how variance might affect the pace at which one can move up in stakes. Link to previous: [Illustrating variance 1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jvya9l/illustrating_variance/)

Current win rates: mean\_2nl = 9.0; mean\_5nl = 8.0; mean\_10nl = 7.0; mean\_25nl = 6.0; mean\_50nl = 5.0; mean\_100nl = 4.0; mean\_200nl = 3.5; mean\_500nl = 3.0; mean\_1000nl = 2.5; mean\_2000nl = 2.0; mean\_5000nl = 1.5; mean\_10000nl = 1.0;

Standard deviation starts at 80 for 2nl and increments by 5 for each stake level eventually reaching 135 for 10knl. This might be too high, them high stakes types don't tend to let us mere mortals know such details.

A poster asked: Why did everyone sprint to 10knl or die? Good question. Flaw in the model. Sorry everyone. Very different results now but I'm much happier with them. Yesterday seemed odd in that the win rates felt pretty ok compared to real life but there aren't that many crushers. 

Replacement image for sim1 below. Notable points, including some things you can't see cos it's hidden in the data:

1. Without variance, the EV of those win rates over 1 million hands is $448,455.
2. Only 4 players are above EV in $ terms out of the 50. They might be close to EV, or above EV, in bb terms over the full million hands but the variance has simply slowed their progression up the stakes.
3. Some players have a fucking rollercoaster! Nobody is at their peak bankroll at the 1 million hand mark which is an odd freak. Bearing in mind there is no tilt in this sim, all win rates are constant. Player 3 peaks at $188,758 but ends with only $1,578. Just. From. Variance. Wow, that would suck. Player 11 peaks at $642,834 but ends at $171,310. More of a loss but still left with a workable bankroll. Player 32 peaks at $285,372 but ends with $7,621. You've got hate that life. Compare to player 36 who peaks at $1,805,820 and ends with $1,463,120. Life changing winnings and the only difference between players is variance and absolutely out of anyone's control.
4. $20 (10bi) is almost enough to avoid busto at 2nl if you can generate a win rate of 9bb/100 from the get go and have standard deviation of 80. Only one player goes bust and he lost 1.5bi on his first 100 hand session and never recovered above that, eventually busting after 4,100 hands. If your win rate is lower, or standard deviation higher, you might need another deposit or two or more, we'll see with the PLO sim.

Part 3 will be the PLO edition. Increased standard deviation which will probably require re-buys. Comments welcome as well as any ideas for other things to look at.

Trip aces jack kicker vs full house (flopped set)

pocket 3s vs K9 on a (KK9) 3 turn

I bet my strong hands for three streets like this and when I get raised on the river it's always THE NUTS. Do you all have the discipline to fold such strong hands as I've described?

I understand folding is an exploit, but I just think for example medium strength flush vs nut flush could be raised by the naked ace of spades (at least I would make this play) on the river, which is why I justify calling. I guess population literally never bluffs river raises.",1605712124

If you ask an outsider who doesn't play poker, often he will think it's all about luck and hitting your cards. While this may be exciting for some, I think it's the main reason why chess is more respected by the public and poker will always be an inferior game.

I am $5 in the BB. 4 limpers, I make it $40. I have everyone covered ($3k deep). 3 people call - it's a splashy game so not surprised.

4 ways to flop of K89 rainbow. I bet $100. The initial limper calls only. 

Turn is Jd (bringing second diamond - although not too relevant).  He had $610 left and I decided to check. He checks back.

River is 8. I bet $260 and he snap shoves for $610 total. Player is tight and aggressive. I haven't really seen him get out of line in many hours of play (50yr old guy). I figured if he had KQ he would have just called river. He made a few river raises already and he had it both times. 

I ended up folding and he never showed. I think my river fold was probably okay.... But who knows..... Anyway, I think given his stack size my error in the hand was assuming the turn was a bad card and taking a pot control line, when I should just bet turn, shove river all day long on this runout. I probably would have check shoved turn if he bet too.

Flop KK10 rainbow. The jackpot bells are ringing in my head.

SB Checks to me. I’m trying to trap so I check to button who also checks.

Turn A of diamonds with 2 diamonds on the board.  Great card for me since I’m hoping an Ace got there. Checked to me, I pot size bet, button calls, SB folds.

River A hearts. 

I lead out for 3x pot get raised all in (about 30 BB more at our home game) and tank before folding. I play with these guys a lot. Theres no way they would call without an Ace after that turn. I literally call out that this is “the sickest run out possible” as I muck.

8411,Using folded cards as blockers,poker,"I'm a fairly new poker player, only started to play properly this year so forgive me if this is a stupid question.

I was wondering if it would be possible to use a read on the cards of players who folded as blockers.

A couple of ways I imagine this working:  


1. You're in the small blind playing deep stacked and everyone from UTG to the button snap folds their cards. You use this information to determine that it's unlikely any of them folded an ace or a hand like KQ, meaning it's more likely the BB has a strong hand and you might want to play more conservatively.
2. You're sitting with something like pocket jacks in the small blind. The button raises and you flat call, then the big blind 3 bets. The button tanks for a very long time before eventually folding. You use the fact that the button tanked for a very long time to determine that there is a very solid chance he was holding a weak to middling ace. You could use this information to determine it's less likely the big blind has an ace himself. (obviously you couldn't be sure the button had an ace, maybe he had something like pocket eights, but you can decide that there is a solid chance he did have an ace).

This might be a totally impossible strategy to implement, or so thin in its value that it isn't worth trying but I'd be interested to hear any thoughts on it.",1605424297

it's the very beginning, where he slides over his cards to the guy next to him and everyone goes nuts.  Did he fold there?  Did he call?  I have no clue what happened.  Anyone that knows about this guy and followed it, can you explain that hand in layman's terms?

In hindsight, I think that I missed some value in this hand. I was planning to check-shove the turn but villian checked through. Should I have led out? Obviously, my hand got a lot weaker when I got counterfeited on the river. In hindsight, I think I still should have bet for value since I think villian will often try to realize the equity of his ace and king high hands by checking through. It was awkward sizing wise though because I only had a pot-sized bet behind. I think a pot size bet is over repping my hand since I can only get value from pocket pairs and ace highs but I also can't really bet-fold in this situation.

8457,I unwillingly made a poker rival at the card house...,poker,"I did my typical buy-in and after about 2 hours I was a bit less than even. I bought in for $200, got to $350 then whiffed a nut flush draw and lost $200 so my stack was around $150 when the following happened.

Hero gets AKo UTG and opens $15. 7 people call (!!!!!!!!!!)

Flop: K23 2 hearts. Checks to BTN, who bets $125. SB folds, BB tanks for a bit then folds. I tank for a loooong time before folding. UTG+1 (the guy this story is about) insta-jams for $600. Btn snap calls.

Turn bricks, river is a K. BTN flips over pocket 3's for the boat, and UTG+1 yells ""Mine's bigger!!"" And flips over K2o. Scoops a massive pot. BTN is incredulous, me and BB discuss how everyone got a piece of the flop as he had a flush draw and I had the other K. 

My time is running short (no rake room, have to pay for seat time) and the maniac who had K2o offers to buy me some time since ours are both going to run out simultaneously. I happily accept, even though I was ready to just cut my losses and go. 

3 hands after the time hits, I get AKss and maniac calls my all in after I hit the nut flush on the turn. Doubles me up and more to $350.

Dealer change happens not long after that and there's a bomb pot, double board. I get K5o and flop 2 pair on one board and OESD on the other. Someone to my right jams all in and I remember, maniac tanks for a while before making the call. 

I hit my straight on the turn and my 2p doesnt improve to anything, but I wind up scooping the side pot from maniac who had a smaller 2p on one board and J high on my straight board. I split the main pot with the all in. I wind up with around $700, and just fold the rest of my time out. 

As I'm cashing out I go to tip the dealers and maniac whines about me paying him back for time, jokingly(?) So I give him double what he paid for my time. I could tell he was salty as the bottom of a bag of Lays with how he congratulated me. 

I don't think he'll be giving away any more seat time to people after this.

Has anyone here ever triple check raised or been triple check raised?",1605303786

8496,Weird angle witnessed at live 1/2,poker,"I wasn’t part of this situation or hand, but had a front row seat and wanted to share as a cautionary tale, if you play in a game with “tip chips.” I won’t go into too much hand detail because I don’t remember it all that well, and it isn’t really relevant.

HJ raises to $10 pre and everyone but the SB calls. The flop comes QXX rainbow and the SB leads out for like half pot. HJ thinks for a bit and calls. Turn is a J, and SB bets full pot. HJ thinks for a bit again and calls. River is a blank. SB jams and has HJ covered.

So, this room is a “club” with an hourly fee and no rake. For some reason, you can’t tip the dealer with real chips, so they instead sell tip chips which sit next to your stack but are not in play. You can’t even buy these tip chips from the dealer. They have to come from the cage or be exchanged for real chips with another player.

HJ thinks for a moment and flips one of these tip chips into the middle, for what seemed like an obvious call signal to the entire table. SB immediately flips over KQ. HJ looks and says “I fold.”

Everyone looks at the HJ quizzically, and he explains that he was just tipping the dealer and not intending to call. Obvious bullshit, but technically speaking, the chip wasn’t in play, so the floor gets called. Floor hears the situation, and concludes that since the chip wasn’t in play and HJ didn’t say call, he can now fold. But he warns him for angling and says that if he tries it again, it’s a call.

Whole table is silent, and SB just shakes her head and scoops up what is in the pot. I gotta hand it to her, because I would have made much more of an argument. In any case, from now on, I’m not flipping my hand over unless I hear the words “call.” Especially when there are tip chips involved.",1605298588

8503,Weird floor ruling... your thoughts?,poker,"Playing a $240 Survivor tourney last night at MGM NH. I have QQ, I raise UTG. Folds to Button who tanks for a bit. 

While Button is tanking, Small Blind calls out of turn. Clearly pushes out an amount of chips equal to a call (my bet was 2.5K, he pushes out 3 1K chips). It happens, no big deal, Dealer tells him and he pulls his chips back.

Button eventually calls. Then Small Blind tries to raise. Floor is called, and rules that since it wasn't Small Blind's action when he acted, it's not binding and he is still allowed to choose to raise. 

Am I crazy, or is there no way Small Blind should be allowed to do anything besides call there? 

Not salty, I 4bet pre and he called and then I caught a punt from him on the turn and doubled up, just a baffling situation. I've never seen a floor rule that out of turn action is anything besides binding. What am I missing?",1605291686

\-------------

basically had KK in sb, UTG opens to 700, 2 callers. I make it 3300, roughly 4x. I'm wondering if my sizing is too low, but with such a strong hand I want to play vs at least initial raiser, not just get the blinds. all 3! call, BB, UTG and +1. flop is AJ6x. obviously A is in at least UTG and +1's ranges, but he could also have a lot of PP (QQ-TT) as well. he only bets 25% pot so I feel i can call and reevaluate on turn. everyone else folds. V is UTG+1 which i guess can make his range a tiny bit wider, but not by much. turn comes A, and this is where i have a question. obv extra A makes it less likely that V has an ace, but is that enough for me to change my actions? I was leaning twards a turn fold if V bet out more than 50% pot. according to equaliab im still 40% fav after the flop, and after turn im actually almost even odds to win. V makes it half pot around 10.5k, and honestly the fact that the A blocked a lot of his Ax combos convinced me to call. didnt realize V only had 5k behind, i dont know if that would've influenced my deicison at all. 

i guess my question is, how much do you let blockers and board texture changing cards influence your decision? i guess GTO would dictate you don't let it at all, and just go by hard numbers, but realistically, should I have just folded to the turn bet? i think folding on flop is way too nitty, unless i have some type of sick soul read. any input would be appreciated.",1605286745

My thoughts: Preflop seems standard, can't imagine anyone would have any issues with that.

Flop: Also seems standard, I have the board locked up and am losing to sets only which I block. I call planning with the intent of giving V a little rope and either betting if checked to or putting in a raise on the turn.

Turn: V continues and I raise too small here. I should've made it probably 20 BB instead. V is priced in to call with any straight draw or flush draw, and if he has a combo draw with extra outs like a gut shot even better for them.

River: V checks and H bets small for value. I think I can get called by Kx, Jx, weaker Broadway combos like KT and JT, maybe even QQ or AA that can't fold to a small bet. And then I get shoved on. Thoughts? 

Feels too nitty to check back with top two. AQ and Q9 get there but Both gut shots so it doesn't really make sense for V to hold those hands unless they're exactly suited diamonds. Should I let go of top two as an exploit or am I just supposed to close my eyes and call? 10NLz doesn't have a lot of check jams on the river, its more of a 50NLz move in my experience.",1605275520

Turns out Gardens has an even worse game structure. 2/3 with a $200 cap with $7 max rake. And that’s what EVERY other casino in LA does as well.

8592,You can exploit without knowing GTO,poker,"Some people think it’s impossible to exploit accurately unless you know GTO. I just wanted to let you know that this is nonsense. All you need, to accurately exploit, is to find profit.

Example:

Let’s say the pot is $100, you have no showdown value, and an imaginary opponent folds 90% of the time to a pot size bet. If you bet pot -

9 out of 10 times you win $100
1 in 10 times you lose $100.
If you made this bet 10 times you’d make $800 profit.
Average profit per bet = $80.

When exploiting, you only make plays if you can find the profit. If you can’t, you fold. 

It’s very easy to calculate your exploitative profit in this way. It’s far more complex to start with GTO and calculate your exploitative play from there, and it’s no more accurate to do so.",1605175854

8607,Anybody know what this card game is called?,poker,"The people who taught it to me called it Chinese Poker. But after looking up Chinese poker, that's not it.

4 people, deal 13 cards to each person. The objective is to get rid of all your cards first. 

Gameplay: you play a hand of either 1,2,3, or 5 cards using poker rules. (if you play a single card, it's just a high card. If you play 2 or 3 cards they have to be 2 or 3 of a kind respectively. 5 cards can be a straight, flush, full house, 4 of a kind with a kicker, or straight flush)

The play goes clockwise and each player can either play a hand with the same number of cards that can beat the previous hand, or pass until a new round starts. Once nobody can beat the hand that is showing, that player starts a new round with any number of cards.

Whoever has the 2 of clubs goes first and must play it as part of their hand. Suit ranking is Spade, Heart, Diamond, Clubs (clubs are low).

8610,Do you fold hands when you are odds favorite when on the final table of a tourney?,poker,"&amp;#x200B;

I had about 25 BB's with pocket 10's on the button and everyone folds to me. So I raise the blinds to 3BB and the small blind goes all in. Now this guy has a very predictable pattern - he calls when he has a big pair, and raises when he has overcards or a small pair. I know this because he's been to my right for most of the tourney. So I put him on two over cards. But if I call, it's nearly all my stack and I could go from 4th to basically out of the tourney.

&amp;#x200B;

So I figure I am better but is it worth the risk?  If I basically double up it puts me as the chip leader.

8618,Ok I’m kind of drunk but hear me out. I think I figured out a workaround for legal online poker in the US.,poker,"So online raffles are legal. Additionally, online raffles that incorporate games to win additional raffle entries are legal. So hear me out, man..

Hear me out. 

You make a poker site where you do poker tournaments. Each tournament costs 1 raffle ticket to enter (whatever the entry price you want for you tournament is the cost of a raffle ticket). Each purchase of the raffle ticket gets you 1 entry for each prize drawing. 

The prizes for the raffle are 
Prize drawing #1: first place prize
Prize drawing #2: second place prize
Etc. 

As part of the fun experience of a raffle, purchasing a ticket also gets you access to a “Just-For-Fun!” poker tournament in which the winner can win even more raffle tickets! (but no cash prize...remember this is only for funsies. We wouldn’t want people to be able to make decisions about what to do with their own money)

The winner of the tournament will also win an additional 50 trillion tickets for prize drawing #1. The second place winner will automatically win 50 trillion tickets for prize drawing #2. And so on. 

So, including their purchased ticket, the first place winner will have 50,000,000,000,001 tickets in prize drawing #1. Everyone else will have however many tickets they purchased. 

After the completion of the tournament a winning ticket is randomly selected from each prize drawing. Assuming 50 people entered the tournament, non-winners will have approximately a 1:1,000,000,000,000 chance of winning, which isn’t zero so it’s technically still a fair raffle. 

FAQ

-Don’t most states have a law saying no purchase is necessary?

Yes! You can enter the raffle and no purchase is necessary! Just send a separate self-addressed stamped postcard for each entry to:
PO Box 963
New York City
New York State 10108

Unfortunately, at this time, non-purchased tickets do not qualify you to join our free online “Just-For-Fun!” tournament.",1605137057

8621,Looking for some motivation and advice,poker,"Let me start by saying I’ve been a winning player online for the almost 100K hands I’ve played (total among all stakes up to 50nl). This of course led me to believe that I’m a good player and as a result I’ve not studied rigorously. But I’m starting to realize that this is not the case. My opponents are adjusting, my bluffs arent working, I don’t know why I’m 3 betting and barreling etc I just do it because it “feels” right (using basic concepts like range/nut advantage)- and it’s always worked. 

So I feel like my overly aggressive (but not maniac, I open maybe 50% OTB and 3B around 12-15%) play style is leading me to punt. I just moved up to 50nl and lost like $400 in 2 days. 

One thing I am realizing is I don’t think in terms of ranges and combos on that level, although I know how to count combos. Like I see a scary board and think “this isn’t good for him, I should bluff since it’s good for me”. But I’d really like to start thinking in terms of balanced ranges and actually think like a good player- what should be my bluffs and value bets here so I’m balanced? What sizes should I use? Should I check strong hands here? Etc..”

In terms of training, ive used upswing in the past but cancelled because I didn’t really find it helpful and their videos contradicted themselves,. I read NLHE for advanced players, most of TGM, and I own Splitsuit preflop workbook, MPT, the theory of poker, Excelling at NLHE, and I just got Mastering Small Stakes NLHE. MPT I think is extremely dense for my level lol. I also own flopzilla but I haven’t used it much.

So TLDR, I thought I was good given my success but am realizing I’m not gonna get anywhere if I don’t put in serious training. I’m realizing that I don’t really know why I take actions that I take and why I use certain net sizes, I just do it. What do you all suggest I do?

Somehow, I started thinking about poker again. Then about a month ago, YoutubeTV randomly ""recommended"" old reruns of WPT (Google can read my thoughts?). I started watching more poker on TV. Then I started half heartedly playing Zynga, not so much for the action, but just to see if I could still calculate the odds like I could back then. It was fun, and I found myself most nights sitting on my couch playing for play money while watching TV. And so now I'm wondering... can online poker be a good pastime for the dead of winter? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read a million posts on here, read the [where to play wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/wiki/where-to-play), studied up a bunch on how the game has changed in the past 13 years, etc etc. But in all of that, I've also read a ton of horror stories, including [this latest one](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jrc866/why_are_americans_forced_to_use_shitty_offshore/), and now I'm nervous. Are these horror stories true? I am US based, and comfortable using bitcoin, but are sites like Ignition and ACR really as shady as they sound? Are there any truly above board online poker rooms, or is it all bots and withdrawal runarounds? If I play for money, will I ever see the fruits of my labor, or am I better off sticking with Zynga and 5 all in calls per round?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm never going to quit my day job, but I love the math of the game, and I feel like it could be a good way to spend the dark days of winter. I just don't want to get ripped off. Your input is appreciated!",1605120383

8634,2/5 Hand Analysis,poker,"Hi everyone question on this hand. This is a 2/5 game where you can buy in to the largest stack. I'm sitting with 1400 and V covers me. V seems like a thinking player but has been tilted this session since he got coolered a few hands back.

Hand starts with me picking up AQdd in UTG. The table is 6 handed and I raise to 30, V is UTG +1 and calls. Everyone else in the hand also calls except for button. Pot is 150.

Flop comes out 484dds, sb and bb check and I bet 95. V raises to 265. Folds around back to me and I put in a call. Pot is 680.

Turn comes Jd, I'm now sitting with nut flush and asking what hand could he raise with on flop. My thought process was that he may have a 4 in his hand and I would imagine he thinks I have an overpair or a bluff. As such, I decided to check the turn. To my surprise he checks back. Pot is 680.

River comes a 3h. At this point I decide I have to go for some value and I bet 250. He thinks and then raises to 750. Any ideas on what I should do here? I decided to call, but I have no clue what he checks the turn with or what his hand is. Obviously top flush is pretty strong, but I hesitated only because checking the turn seemed to me like he already had a great hand on the flop.

As such with most coolers on this thread, he flipped over 34cc. I have no clue if my check back on the turn was bad. Hand analysis welcome as im a scrub thanks.",1605119485

I'm getting back into poker after a nice 4 year break (not that I played more than 5k hands back then) and I'm trying to stop myself from being a mega-fish post flop. 

I feel like I'm starting to get preflop play, I have a decent idea of what hands I actually want to open with, and what hands I want to 3-bet with (I try not to cold call since it just gets me in trouble post flop most of the time) based on position. Easy enough. 

But once the flop comes I turn into a total faucet. Leaks everywhere. I understand that 1500 hands isn't a lot, but I don't know how big of a sample size I need to know that I'm lost after the flop. Sure it's easy when you flop garbage on a wet board, or when you flop TPTK, but I really struggle when I'm oop and I hit nothing (especially vs the blinds or a caller), or when I get middle pair with something like K5s from the btn vs the blinds. Does anyone have tips on where I could learn some more information on post-flop play so I don't feel lost most hands?

As for myself, again I've only played 1500 hands so far so my stats don't mean much but I'll post them here:

8687,Did my Friend rig the Deck??!,poker,"Okay, stick with me here, there is a lot i need to explain and I am not great on the terminology of everything.

So me and my friends had a home game last night. We were 6 handed. My one friend, lets call him Max, is the one that is in question of rigging the deck. Here is the whole situation, this is all the VERY FIRST HAND.

While me and the rest of my roommates were getting the table ready, etc. Max for some reason had the deck of cards we were using in the other room. The rest of us didn't know where the deck was, until Max came back and said he had shuffled and was getting ready. None of us thought anything about it.

Now, we all take our seats, (random) and Max deals out the card in order to us, first player to get an Ace misses the blinds. I get the first Ace, so little blind is on my left. This is where it gets weird.

Max takes back the cards he just dealt to determine blinds, puts them on the bottom of the deck, and DOES NOT shuffle again. Instead, he starts dealing. Max ended up being big blind on the hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

We get our cards, I fold 57o, but that will be important later. The flop comes 9h 6h 6d. Round of betting. SB also folded, so Max leads. UTG, UTG+1,2 and 3 call. Turn is 8h. Round of betting. All players call Max's bet again. River is Ks. This time, Max checks. UTG bets, and UTG+1 shoves all in. Player to his left calls, comes back to Max who calls, and UTG calls. UTG has AA, (two pair but cmon, pocket aces.) UTG+1 has KK(highest full house) and UTG+2 has 99( Lower full house.) But MAX, HAS 57h!!! (Straight Flush!) I folded, however would've made a straight.

Max takes the pot of 3 other All In calls, and triples his stack on the very first hand. We were all convinced he did something to the deck. Ordered it in a specific way. One, he shuffled in an other room while the rest of us were distracted. Two, he dealt and DID NOT shuffle again after dealing high card for blind, just put in the bottom of deck. Three, all other players, including me, had a very strong hand that all lost to his. UTG's were mostly newer players, and had enticing hands to ship everything. Even me, a more experienced player would have shipped with all of their hands most of the time. 

What are the odds of this? I have NEVER seen a runout like this, one which involves 4 hands, all extremely strong. Never on TV, or playing live. Do you guys think he cheated? Did he arrange the cards to run like this in the other room? It just seems so suspicious, and the runout is absolutely INSANE.

Before you ask, most of the players were genuinely new, so there weren't any raises pre flop or 3-betting or anything like that, which would have made the action much different if we were all experienced. The play was pretty straight forward, which Max knew it would.

&amp;#x200B;

He ended up floating the rest of night, and won at the end.

After lurking on this subreddit and playing a bit of live poker, I am not accustomed to online poker bet sizing.... particularly when it comes to 3!, 4! etc, opening while OOP, squeeze sizing, etc.

in general, for live I follow my own guidelines of

1. if OOP, open bigger than normal (until I find one that works for iso)
2. squeeze play, find standard 3! size and add 1bb per limper

But when doing this live, i get into alot of tricky spots since standard opens are 3x bb and SPR are always greater online than in live in these spots.

Once the Dealer's Choice game is played, the DC puck moves to the right, and the dealer button moves left as usual. Its a nice mix in the monotony of NLHE.

1/2 cash game, 8 handed, 10$ button straddle I'm in BB with about 125bb stack villain has me covered

Sb folds I call straddle with AJ spades. About 2 callers behind me, villain puts $50 on top, I call and it's heads up to the flop. Villain is a regular who is always deep stacked but isn't the type to just throw it around like a maniac. I think he has a strong hand but am new to the concept of ranges so any info about that would be helpful. I'd put him on JJ or better or AK. Flop is Ah 9s 6s I bet about 1/2 pot, villain calls. I figure it's at least a blocking bet for pot control and I feel relatively strong here. The turn is Jc and I pause and bet $100 into what was about a $240 pot and villain puts me in for the rest and I call. Villain has AA and I bricked on the river. 

Up until that point I am pleased with my play. I have been playing for about 5 months now and am down overall but I think I'm improving. Today I played for about 3 and a half hours and was up 20 to 120 bucks throughout most of the time. I felt like I shouldn't have got sucked into this one after the initial raise but I know I had to shove after the re-raise on the turn.

8737,High Hand Promotion Silliness,poker,"I was involved in a hand that ended up being a high hand. 

It was right at the change of the time frame. 

I didn’t know the rules on the high hand and only was paying attention because the guy next to me said “looks like this is the last one for a couple hours hopefully we can get it.” 

At that point I looked at the clock and it had switched over. 

I was on the BB with K5 off and it limps around and I check. Flop was KK5, which was perfect. I’m not thinking high hand, just trying extract value. By the end of the hand I managed to find a way to get some chips from another guy and am happy. 

I know it’s a high hand so I ask the dealer. He said he wasn’t sure if it was dealt before or after but was pretty sure it was before. 

I tell him that I was posted before the clock but cards were dealt after. He calls floor and they allegedly check the cameras and say it was dealt before the last one expired and quads had won that rounds so it was no good. 

It got interesting because it was a table stake for $300 tournaments but in which sells for $150-$200. So the guy next to me knows the cards were dealt after time change. No one else knows but are pissed because it’s their chance to get free money. 

I was not really too concerned because the room was running 15-20 tables and kings full just wasn’t going to hold up anyway. 

But, I know the floor was wrong and I think the way the dealer worded it made their decision rather than them actually checking the cameras. 

So my biggest issue is that I don’t trust the floor now.

8767,The Paisting of Ignition and Learning Microstakes Aren't Dead,poker,"Starting around March of this year, I hit a decent downswing at midstakes and decided to take a break from playing full time to relieve myself of the pressure that comes with online poker. Around September, however, I decided to see if microstakes were indeed ""dead"" as a fun little challenge to try and build a bankroll as a beginner. It filled the black hole in my heart that poker left and allowed me to be the true degenerate my mother shamefully raised. 

I deposited $100+$100, with a 100% deposit bonus on the second bullet to replicate what I thought the average deposit bonus (about 50%) would be across most poker sites. I figured this is what most first time players would deposit to start at 5NL with decent bankroll management (in the beginning). I started initially on Ignition (I'm American, yee-haw), with a couple of rules to set for myself:

* No fancy play syndrome, only ABC low variance poker that a beginner would quickly pick up
* Move up around 16 buy ins at the next highest and most popular stake
* Move down around 13 buy ins
* Play average sessions during normal peak hours
* Quit when I got bored or made what I thought a decent return for a beginner would be

Ignition micros are truly as soft as you would assume, playing 5NL fast fold and getting the roll to around $400 in total after a few thousand hands. I then moved to the next most popular stake, 25NL zone, and got the roll to around $700. 

***Graph*** 

https://imgur.com/JTePF3t

***Results***

https://imgur.com/Zm2VGYq

There was a dip in the middle of 25NL where I realized that most microstakes players aren't bluffing, but for the most part it went relatively smoothly battling out the $4 per hour basement regs and drunk degen punters. I would say I ran relatively good (LOL sample size hur dur), but I was playing slightly low variance poker. I then deposited about the same balance on ACR to test out the microstakes there and realized that they are a nitty fuckfest. I made another $300 or so, became a thousandaire and decided a beginner would be overjoyed at that point and called it a job well done. 

***PT4 fuckup, so here is a replication of my ACR results:***

https://imgur.com/scVGWr2


Well I had so much fun the first time, I decided how well you can play being an absolute nit bitch that has become so popular at the micros on sites like ACR. Here is my second go of playing like a pussy at 5NL.

***Graph***

https://imgur.com/6MuIuYD

Finishing up the challenge last night, I played who I believe to be the infamous Paisting, or at least his American equivalent, whaling it up harder than anyone has ever whaled. This legend was shipping it pre with any two against a limp or open shoving, getting his stack to 200-300 BB and then playing like a regular fish. After losing a massive pot with an average of third pair (and his massive stack) he began shipping it pre with any two again. 

***Here is the 5NL reg table and the stacks he gifted the first time around:***

https://imgur.com/DYWFCug


I realized punting off more than 200 bb isn't something a nit bitch would do, so I ratholed and tried sitting the same table. I got on the table a couple more times, but he eventually donated a 2000 bb stack to one of the players who was equally as degen. 

***Another time through:***

https://imgur.com/a/CEGgwDv

Luckily for American Paisting, my all in game versus him wasn't as successful. Here are some hands:

8779,Hand review help,poker,"Ok so I am still learning, I'll start with that. I also know I made mistakes in this hand. Looking in advice for how to get over mind blocks in a situation like this. 

$2/$3 spread limit ($300 max bet) 

H: UTG, $325 effective. 
V1: UTG+1, $900ish
V2: CO, $180ish

Hero dealt 2h 2d. $3 limp *
Utg1 raise to $15, lj co and h call

Hero check, utg1 bet $25, co all in. H fold* utg1 call
T: 8s
R: 5c

Utg1 ahkh
Co 10h 7h

So I know limping is bad and playing pocket 2 utg is also bad. But in this situation as played out, against the ranges I had about 65% on the flop. Against the actual hands I was closer to 80%. I figured one of them was on a draw, not both.

8789,Awkward situation at the poker table......am I in the wrong?,poker,"So I'm playing in my local 2/5 game and a player I've never played before sits down to my right for the minimum ($300). He is a 32-39 yr old male with sports clothes on.

His phone is on the table rail. He starts watching videos of young girls (I assume over 18) doing sexy dances and stripteases. These were mostly ""bras and pants ON"" but a few ""bras OFF"" too. It skrikes me as poor etiquette, but I'm willing to ignore it. 

However, it got worse when he switched to actual porn with woman sticking objects in places. He tried to cover the phone with his arms, but seriously it was in display to anyone paying attention. I didn't really want to say anything....

Anyway, he kept leaving the table and coming back a few times (I figured he was away to masturbate since he was in the restroom for extended periods of time). Again, he would come back, and straight back to the strip dances or porn. I hated the idea of a guy with a boner sitting next to me. 
 
So anyway I'm in a hand with him and I flop a giant draw (9dTd on a 7d8Kd flop). We get the $$$ in I brick out. I show the T high, and he does some weird about to muck motion, then looks back at hand, then about to muck, then looks back, then turns over K4. In fairness he was barely paying attention because he was watching a video of some guy squeezing a woman's butt. So I snapped after the slow roll and called the floor over saying he was watching porn and he needed to get kicked out.

The player gets v.angry at me, saying he wasn't watching anything (lying) and accuses me of being a ""racist cracker"" lmao - whatever that is suppose to mean. He then proceed to say he was going to ""knock me out"" and ""watch my cracker mouth"". The dealers work in rotation, so the dealer at the table didn't really have much oversight in his video watching, and other players didn't want to be on the other side of a verbal attack. 

Anyway, floor gets called over and starts trying to calm player down. I was fairly angry too, and stressed just now much porn he was watching, and floor kept telling me to quiet down or I would be removed from the table lmao. The guy continued his verbal assault on me, floor barely said anything to him, and told me he hadn't broke any rules. I'm fairly certain this is a bulls*** call and I'm dealing with a bunch of morons. Anyway, the tension fizzled out and 40mins or so later, he stats watching porn again under the table, I can see his phone in my line of view.......

Anyway, I just left, livid, and told the floor on my way out he was watching porn again. They had zero interest, probably because they didn't want to go anywhere near this problem.

Then at the break/freezeout, every single person at my table topped off for around $135, so short stacks became big ones and bigger ones became bigger. I was medium stacked and didn’t want to throw $135 plus on top of the $30 tourney fee, to hopefully at least min cash for $330.. Then after freeze-out there was an ante so you basically had to pay two BBs every-time you were BB.. Overall it was kinda fun, but it just kinda seemed like a sham from the house to suck people for money. I could sound like a total noob for trying a freeroll.. just would like to hear y’all’s opinions on them.

8815,What should be the Opening amount of blinds preflop ?,poker,"Hello ,

My current opening amount while raising is 2.5 BB . I'm hesitating between going to 3 , or something closer to 2 .

To set up things , in my room and limits where i currently play , i have a hard time remembering when someone raise this amount and everyone folded , since BB and SB players are like yeah idc i only have to put ~1 BB to go in , ima defend practically anything , i have very low fold equity unless i go all in .


If i raise to 3 BB maybe i'll get more chips if i win the pot which im more likely to do considering i select better my hands , and maybe i'll get more fold equity ( i know people defend shit like j3o , but i think although i still have much to learn that 1.5 BB to put see the flop with an unsuited connector can be an okay price )

 
However i found this , from Doug Polk , which is also very interesting : https://upswingpoker.com/preflop-open-strategy-rfi-explained/#:~:text=You%20should%20widen%20your%20opening,losses%20when%20faced%20with%20aggression.

8816,"Tips on Tricking Players to Gamble with More Than They Can ""Afford""?",poker,"At my local cardroom there are a bunch of these young kids, three of them, maybe aged 18-20 or so. Come from known families. Set for life. Parents still give them an allowance every week, which they almost always bring to the local cardroom at around 7 PM on Friday (according to them, Friday is ""pay day"").

Here's the thing. They don't really know how to play poker. When they come in, I intercept them and start chatting them up, then pretend that I am about to leave. They usually try to convince me to stay. We are on good terms. So I stay, and we sit down at the same table. 

To give you an idea of how bad they are, they frequently confuse the strength of a hand. For example, last week, one of them forgot that a set beats two pair. I am serious. They are not the brightest bulbs and when the liquor starts getting into them it's even worse. More than that, though, they only play a few hands every week, so they usually don't even have time to learn the rules... which brings us to the topic at hand.

As far as strategy goes. They have none. They bring $500 each every week ($1,500 total) and I am usually able to get at least a few hundred off of them. Sometimes, I am able to get their entire stacks. I am able to do this with extraordinary consistency because if two or three of them are in the pot, and one goes all in, the others go all in too. They see it as a pure gambling game. The other regs at the table get out of the pot, assuming that at least one of them has a monster, right? Not at all. They always go all in within the first five hands, which sets off a chain reaction. If they do not shove, they limp. But, when they limp, they will call a shove, which means I need to just get one somewhat premium hand before I shove. I pray none of the other regs have a good hand, then watch as the three brothers inevitably shove their stacks into the center of the table. Massively +EV. Pays for the majority of my expenses every month.

So, here's what I want to happen. They need to start bringing more cash. Their parents give them $2,500 each per week (insanity, I know, but these are the types of families that live near me). They bring $500, and once the shove fiesta is complete, they leave. I was thinking about holding back the brother who wins on a future week and talking to him. Talk about how he could have tripled/quadrupled $1,000 instead of $500 and have him imagine what that extra money could do for him. If I can convince one brother to do it, the others will likely follow suit, trying to out-macho each other. I was also considering introducing them to PLO.

There is just one thing holding me back. One of the cute dealers at the table doesn't like it when I take their money so blatantly. She gives me a dirty look, but she's beautiful. I've been coming to this cardroom for years and I'm working up the courage to talk to her. I figure if I want a chance with her, then I need to not do anything more than I'm doing to these brothers. I guess I'm torn. Potential relationship and marriage with a cute girl or some extra cash every month from the brothers?",1604859701

.01/.02 zoom on pokerstars

Hero is on Button with AQo

UTG+2 (Stack 45BB) opens to 5BB, 

MP calls,

Flop comes K 6 2 rainbow (Pot 16.5BB)

UTG+2 bets 16BB,

MP folds,

Hero shoves for 40BB effective

UTG+2 calls and shows KK

Now to my thought process. Ok don't bother explaining where my mistake lies I found it ^^'. I assumed his range to be about 10s+ AQo+ but ofc he wouldn't bet potsized with that range. Against this range however my bluff would have been profitable, as I only expect him to continue on a board this dry with KK+ AK, making him fold 62 percent of the time and the calculation would have been:

EV = (32*0.62)-(40*0.38)

EV = 4.64

Currently an engineer looking to quit ASAP. I've had some fortunate luck with the stock market (investing in tesla and amazon ~3 years ago), and I have a considerable amount of savings. Not enough to retire on itself, but I can withdraw $2000 a month for $24k a year. Possibly more depending when i can snag a dealer job.

I've only been working for 4 years, but I'm kinda fed up with it. 

Basically, looking to retire on what I have and supplement with poker dealer income and pursue my art career. 

I'm wondering:

1. Do all casinos offer health insurance to dealers? And if so, can you get the health benefits as a part time worker or do you have to be full time? Preferably, i deal part time.

2. California or vegas for poker dealing? I live in california, and would like to stay here, but I'll go to where the wages/benefits are better and where its easiest to get a job.

3. Is getting a dealer job relatively easy? Like, can i send an app in and get replies at a high frequency, or are these jobs actually competitive.

I figure getting a dealer gig rn would definitely be hard, but i feel like itll be easier mid 2021/2022 as covid eases.

HAND ACTION:

Villain is in mid position, and raises 5BB pre.

Hero calls with KdQd on the button.

Small blind folds, Big blind calls.  All others fold.

Flop comes: KhKc9s (Pot = 15.5BB)

BB checks, Villain raises 11BB, Hero calls, BB folds

Turn comes: KhKc9s 6d (Pot = 37.5BB)

Villain raises 28BB, Hero calls

River comes: KhKc9s6d 4s (Pot = 93.5BB)

Villain raises 90BB

&amp;#x200B;

ADDTL BACKGROUND:

I've played with villain on 5-6 different occasions.  He is pretty tight pre-flop and I've never seen him show a bluff.

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTION:

Should Hero call this river bet?

&amp;#x200B;

MY THOUGHTS:

I think villain's range consists of: AK (4 combos), KJ (2 combos), KTs (1 combo), AA (1 combo), 99 (3 combos), 66 (2 combos) -- I only think he raises 5BB pre with half of his 4 KJ combos.  I think he only cbets with 66 2/3 of the time.  And, I think he slows down on the river with almost all of his rockets (hence the 1 of 6 combos).

Given this range, I think I'm winning \~30% of the time (4/13).  And, therefore this is a marginal fold.

Last night I tried some 9 man SnGs, but I noticed a lot of the same players are multi-tabling those. So I tried to look up what the best games are to start with at micro level on Stars, e.g. what games a experienced recreational player has the best chance to make a profit on. I was hoping the answer would be like 18 of 45 man SnGs, but I couldnt find a definitive answer. Some say cash, others say the MTTs, cause of the large fields. But those games take several hours to get ITM, especially at micro stakes. Do you guys have any tips to what games to start grinding recreational?

even from experienced players, i see them fuck up something so fundamental to gambling.

Yet, even after all these years, there is still no sticky or addition to the beginner wiki for it.

Yes, people can just look it up. But they obviously still get confused from the explanation and end up posting here. And, if thats also the argument, technically we shouldnt have what we have in the beginner section since its all material we can research.

I really love the conversation about pot odds when new players bring them up. But it further confuses them because they get a flood of 3 types of people that answer their questions.

1. ones who are correct through out
2. ones who are just outright incorrect
3. ones who are somewhat incorrect, but still gets the math right.

its important imo to understand not just the math, but how its done because if discussions are to occur among others, it will just cause confusion. (i.e. when a clip mentions Ivey has a 4:1 odds, and someone asks a question about that, either 1 of the 3 types of people could be trying to answer, and cause a mess instead)

8889,Why do people keep saying Daniel Negreanu is a better live player than Doug Polk?,poker,"Tl;dr - Despite Negreanu fans repeatedly saying that Negreanu is a better live player than Polk, I cannot find any evidence of this. Polk has a short but very impressive live tournament career and potentially a higher ROI despite Negreanus high live tourneys cashes ranking, and I can find no evidence that Negreanu is a superior live cash player. If you have evidence of Negreanu being a better player I would like to hear it. Thanks. 

-----------------

I find it completely bizarre that so many people here and elsewhere, in the context of the heads up match, are completely convinced that Negreanu is a better live player than Doug. Why do people think this?

A lot of people use total live cashes as THE metric for success, which is obviously silly considering that it doesn't measure profit from these tournaments. Negreanu has actually lost money/broken even playing tournaments in the past 5 years or so despite booking millions in cashes. I have never seen an analysis, but it seems almost certainly true that Polk would have a higher ROI for live tournaments than negreanu.

People also point to bracelets, which is an even sillier metric for judging performance. But even going by that metric, Negreanu is not an obvious winner. Polk won as many bracelets in 2014 - 2017 as Negreanu did from 2008 - present, despite Polk playing in a fraction of the number of events as Negreanu over that time. And that's if you include two bracelets won outside of Vegas (Europe and Asia wsop respectively). So despite having fewer bracelets,  Doug actually has a higher bracelet per entry rate than Negreanu.

So it's not even clear that Negreanu is a better tournament player than Polk, and live tourneys are meant to be his bread and butter.

And then there's cash games. A lot of Negreanu fans have seen Polks big bluffs in the Aussie Millions cash games against Antonius and Ivey respectively, neither of which got through, but by no means were they bad bluffs. But other than that, why exactly do people think Polk isn't a good live cash player? And why would they think Negreanu is? I seriously don't know what they're basing this off. There isn't obvious evidence of Negreanu being a good high stakes live cash player. He lost a lot of money on HSP and PAD. He ran really poorly too, but if he had run well and made a lot of money, his fans would be using it as proof of his live cash game ability. So really, there's zero evidence of Negreanu being a better live cash player.

Further, there seem to be a lot of people who think Negreanu is somehow a 'live reads' genius, and even more absurdly, that live reads are why Negreanu won the live 200 hands against Polk (!). This appears to be based on a lot of old videos of Negreanu playing in tournaments against amateur players and calling out their hands. Ignoring the fact that the only ones that make it into compilation videos are the ones he gets right, its as if people think that other pros aren't making great reads against their opponents all the time. They obviously ARE, but they just aren't vocalizing it.

Finally, a separate but related point is that so many Negreanu fans keep saying goofy shit like Doug lost the live hands because he didn't have HUDs, charts, solvers etc and that's why he is a favourite online. Ignoring the fact that this match doesn't allow the use of these tools, this type of comment displays a stunning ignorance of online poker and why Doug is genuinely such a massive favorite. The reason why Doug is such a favorite is not because of something peculiar to online play per se, its because Doug is a much, much better heads up player than Negreanu (even without charts and HUDs) and that online allows for a huge volume of hands to be played in a reasonable time period so that Dougs edge will dominate over the variance over a smaller number of hands. Doug is not dependent on any of those tools to be good at heads up, he just uses them because you have to if you're playing the top guys in the world at the highest stakes. If its so easy to win with these tools, then I would suggest you win them to crush online games.

8897,Doug Polk Vs Daniel Negreanu: Online Match #1 Writeup,poker,"Going off of memory on this writeup to give everyone a TLDW overview bear with me.

Today, was the first day of the online portion of the 12.5k hands (loser can opt out) / 25k hand heads up battle.

With Doug being down around 100k from the live session fireworks started off early. Continuing where he left off, Doug was caught bluffing in a few spots where Daniel flopped top pair and checked down to river or rivered top pair. Polk was down about a buy-in or more fairly quick. With his aggression never wavering it is fairly evident that Doug will win the majority of the smaller pots compared to Daniel's strategy of trying to let Doug over-bluff. 

Two hands were five bet all in shoves during the middle of the match where Doug held QQ for both vs Daniels TT and AQ. The AQ was fairly loose as they were significantly over 100BB but Daniel mentioned this was a low frequency play by him (which makes it complately standard). Two noticeable mistakes were seen by myself and the commentators in the session.

Hand #1 Doug A7 vs Daniel JsXs was raised pre and checked down to the river. On the river Doug rivered trip 7s and Daniel rivered a flush. Doug check raised Daniel and Daniel just called with his jack high flush fairly quick without even considering reraising for value. Not a massive mistake but definitely leaving value out here

Hand #2 80ishk Effective. Doug AA vs Daniel 7c9c. Doug 3 bet pre and Daniel called. Flop 588 Doug cont bet Daniel Called. Turn 8. 5888 Board. 15k pot Doug bet 15k and Daniel called. River 9. 58889 Board. Doug shoves and Daniel calls the river. The turn here is an obvious mistake and the post interview Daniel mentioned he was planning on calling turn here to shove river since he blocked a few hands that held an 8. How bad of a mistake? I think it is fairly big and don't like this play at all but since it is such a weird spot to bluff since Doug should be calling off any overpair makes it a scary spot since it doesn't make that much sense of why he would be bluffing here.

Takeaway, while Hand #2 was fairly bad, the overall match is being won with Doug's constant aggression and also his overbets to take more pots away on the river. 100k up is nothing in the larger scheme of things, so people need to stop overreacting every-time someone takes the lead for 2.5x buyins. We can expect the winner to be up around 500k-1.5m on average by the end.

8928,About the most recent 888 client update,poker,"So... the lobby is a mess. I'm still yet to find the option to customize and save filters (if there's any).

Also, the ""hide my bankroll"" option doesn't work at all, the balance remains visible whether I want it or not.

Table themes and UI remain the same, unfortunately. The player's note system still super user-unfriendly and one must rely on third party softwares to make it more bearable.

I'm opening this thread in hopes that it reaches someone from 888. At least fix the goddamn ""hide my bankroll"" option! It's triggering me as hell.

8934,Question which flush is better,poker,"I feel unbelievable stupid asking this since I’ve been playing poker for quite some time now and the past half year more and more serious. This means I am winning at the .5/.10 tables online consistently. This week made a 70’dollar profit. I know for many of you this is peanuts but it is to show that I do know how to play and outplay my opponents on a deeper level than completely beginners. 

Something stupid happened to me playing this asshole till showdown. There were 4 hearts to a flush on the board. I had a small heart in my hand. There was also an ace of hears on deck. No other K J or Q of hearts. 

He was really betting strange and I had made quite a profit and he bet a big portion of my profit for the day. And he made me lay down my flush (with my I think a 9 of hearts).. while there was an ace high on the board. 

I thought he would have a higher kicker.. like a k q or j of hearts. 


But isn’t it just an ace high flush, split pot? 

I feel so stupid for asking this since I’ve been playing poker pretty well consistently .. but he got in my head and now I’m doubting myself. 

P.s. I later won  all his money and after some unfortunate name calling from both sides he left.",1604539663

8950,A very disabled man sat down at my 2-5 game,poker,"It was very obvious this man was both physically and mentally disabled...  He could not walk or even speak, he would communicate by grunting to his caretaker, who could understand him and would vocalize to the table what he wanted to say.  The caretaker would also lift up his cards so he could see them and move his chips once he told her how he wanted to play.

He bought in for the max 1k, after explaining (as always, through the caretaker) that he had just bagged a 20k jackpot on a slot machine and wanted to play in the ""big game"".  He was in a great mood from the slots, even though he must have dumped about 4k (he busted and bought back in a few times) to the table in the two hours I played with him.  The pros at the table did a very good job of making conversation with him, certainly in order to get him to stay longer - I can't really fault the pros for that.

It was a pretty tough table too, there were 3 known pros, myself, and 4 ok regs (who I guess were the fish) that were playing when he arrived.  Tbh I was probably also a fish at this table, but I felt like I was on my A game, and I don't mind facing good players occasionally.

I felt bad playing with him, and left after 2 hours or so, although I don't really know if I feel bad because it seemed like I was taking advantage of him, or if it was just because I was running like dogshit in my hands against the better players.  Probably some of both.  There's always the thought that ""Well, someone's gonna win a lot from him tonight, might as well be me instead of the pros.""  I won a lot of skalansky dollars at least, although they never materialised into real dollars due to run-bad.  I hope he was able to keep most of his remaining 16k, but knowing how casinos are, I doubt it.

I understand that we're all equal before the law, but high stakes gambling for someone in his position is just infinitely more self destructive than the typical business guy who can afford, and pays 30$ an hour in rake to the house / EV to better players to have some fun once a month.  At the same time, the man was having fun - and how can we deny that from him?!, even if he probably didn't realize how much exactly he was paying for it. The whole experience left a very sour taste in my mouth.",1604518205

I've noticed that, especially online, there just doesn't seem to be any amount that you can bet to push someone off a draw, even over bets usually get called. Also, i feel like if i bet 100% of the time to protect my hand, it narrows my range extremely, and leaves me vulnerable to exploits. 

Is there any merit to giving your opponent a free card here just to disguise your hand range, or should I just accept that i should bet every single time here, and be prepared to fold if the turn improves my opponents range? I do sometimes ""bet on the come"" but my opponent might not know this.

Is there a rule in this situation? Advice?",1604411954
9017,The best poker story I've heard in a while,poker,"My friend was playing in a triple-up tournament where the top 3 players cash. It was down to 4 and he was the chip leader (\~$6k) and the bottom stack had $56. Bottom stack is small blind ($50), so of course everyone wants it to end here. Call, call... fold?? The small blind folded, bringing him to $6?! Well, his fate is all but sealed.

The flop comes and my friend hits a set with a Queen kicker, not that it matters. Time to check down. Check, check, bet? Um, do you not realize the tournament is over if you just want to get paid? So my friend raises them, knowing that as the top stack he has nothing to lose. Now, they were clearly on a foolish mission to prove a point, because you guessed it, they went all in. My friend quickly called, cards were revealed, and they both have the *same* set... their kicker was a 9.

Nothing comes on the Turn or River, the hothead gets knocked out and the guy with $6 manages to get paid out 3X entry! And the best part is, I bet he thought he was so smart for folding on the small blind. What a couple of goobers. I hope you enjoyed the story as much as I did.",1604411540

9045,"Kicked a guy out of my weekly home game for cheating, but I have no proof. What do you guys think?",poker,"So my neighbor shows up for poker, he’s a very good player, says he’s never played before when he first shows up, and he’s taken home 400bb at the very least every session for about 8 sessions. Now maybe he’s just an actual shark and he lied about never playing, whatever, not gonna ban someone for that.

A key point about him is that he never gives money away ever, but sometimes he just feels like “gambling” and will say “hey I’m not gonna look at my cards, who wants to play a big pot?” Every time he does this he has good cards, it’s really bizarre. One time after he did this, someone had QQ, shoved all in for 400bb and he calls (still without looking). It gets to the river and he flips his cards over and he just “happens” to have aces. Now I’m not sure how he would have looked because everyone made a point to watch him closely when he started to pull one of his weird gambles like this.

I looked really closely at the cards next day and I swear there are creases on the aces. It’s very subtle but I just can’t think of any other explanation. Here’s a guy who will fold JJ to a 3-bet sometimes, or fold a set on the river with only like 6 combos of hands that beat him, and he goes all in for 400 bigs without looking? I just don’t buy it. This man never EVER gives his money away.

Another time, halfway through our session he says “are all the cards here? I think we’re missing a card.” We count them and sure enough there’s one missing. How could he know  that? This guy is super observant, he sees literally everything, so I’m thinking maybe he kept track..? But it’s not like we’re playing gin, you only see a fifth of the deck at a time.

So I finally confront him about it and he gets really pissed and tells me I crossed a line, I have no proof, etc. I tell him whatever man no one is gonna miss you stealing their money every week, some of the guys who come to play here are like 20 years old and if they lose 100 bucks every week it means something to them.

This guy was definitely cheating, right? And what kind of cheating was he doing? What about how he knew a card was missing?

9046,The First Steps to the Life of a Punter *LONG*,poker,"TL;DR- I had my first live play experience today. It was fun. Was I a big fish? Almost certainly. Read on if you care to.

So I had my first live play experience today and thought I’d share for others to learn and laugh. 
Some background on me. 

I really began playing about a year and a half ago with college buddies with little $10 buy in nights. Great fun but I wasn’t really all that good. However, it was a great introduction to the game I am now becoming obsessed with.

Fast forward to today. I’ve spent the majority of my free time during the COVID lockdowns and have been studying poker, playing free “play money” sites to get a better feel, and some real money 0.05-0.10 cash games with low stakes tournaments. Now I’ve probably played &lt;100 hours with real money, however I felt that I was comfortable enough to explore live play. I didn’t have work today and did not have anything else to do. I figured why not and that I would give it a shot. I mainly wanted to do this for experience with my play, see how my nerves would be, and just to get an idea with how live poker works.

I work a pretty good job right now for my age (22). As a result I was not really worried about the money. I played 1/3 NLH and bought in for $200. I’m well aware that I wasn’t bankrolled properly, but I wasn’t going to get rich. Again this was for experience and nothing more. When I withdrew my money I was fine with the thought of losing it all. If anything I was surprisingly comfortable with the amount of money, which I thought would have been an issue.

So I pulled up to the casino and was feeling a little nervous, but mostly relaxed. Dude at the front door was super helpful. Gave me a lay of the land and pointed me to the poker tables. I walked over to the cage and got my chips, and went over to the table. Before I started the dealer suggested I go pickup a players card as they were having several deals running for poker. Little nooby I know but hey. First timer.

So here’s when shit gets real interesting real fast for me. I sit down, dealer swipes me in, and I’m ready to go. I was a little confused that they didn’t ask me to post blinds but I didn’t bother to clarify. As soon as the cards start getting dealt, the nerves instantly kick up a notch. However I told myself before I even walked in the door that I would take it slow until I got settled. 

We’re 7 handed and I look down at KdQd in the hijack. Ohfuckme.jpeg. Welp so much for taking it slow, kinda hard not to play this hand. I’m barely following the action before it limps around to me. I take a second to orient myself and make it $15. CO folds, button calls, and folds to the guy on my right who calls. 3 ways to flop. Qc 8d 3d. My heart rate jumps probably another 30bpm. My first live hand ever and I’m sitting with top pair, and a draw to the 2nd nuts. MP checks, I continue for 30. Button calls and MP folds. Turn is the 4d. Clenchmyass.gif. Internally I’m going nuts but out the outside I felt like I looked calm, not even any jitters. Probably not very GTO but I don’t care. YOLO All in. Dude tanks for about 20 seconds. I don’t know if I want a call or fold. Either way I’m still freaking out. Dude eventually lays it down and we pick up our first pot ever. I calmly collect the pot like I’ve done it a million times before. 

Was that the right play? Probably not. Did I make an image for myself at the table? Definitely. Is it good or bad? No clue. 

 I’m still having a hard time focusing when the blinds come around. I had KcQc in the small blind and agreed to a chop for the blinds because I just still needed a minute. Fast forward an orbit later and we’re fully calm and ready to actually play.

I had no idea how much of a swing a single hand could put me on. Noted for the future.

We then go on to fold for several orbits, with the occasional limp/ call with marginal hands. However we get out of the way post flop usually. 

2nd hand worth mentioning, I pick up pocket ducks in late position. I call a bet of around $10, to the flop. Rainbow low cards. For some reason some one continues with a bet of around $18 and I fold. My luck, turn is a 2. Oh well. Definitely need to look more into what sizing I should look for when seeing later streets. Probably not a great play. Maybe hindsight is 20/20

I’ll make the final hand (and most painful) hopefully short. I get dealt kings on the button.  I open to $10. Good sizing??? No. Small blind is a completely new player who has only played a few hands. He calls and it folds around to the hijack who also calls. 3 ways to a board of A 8 3. (Or something like that). SB checks, and  HJ makes it roughly $60. I’m totally stuck and tank for about 20 seconds. I feel like this guy has been trying to bully me a bit, and I talk myself into another jam. Why must you do this. SB snap calls. Double fuck. HJ tanks for slightly longer than I did, and ends up laying down AK. I breathe a sigh of relief, thinking that he blocks the SB from any aces. But no. It’s the GTO play I dreamt of. SB turns over pocket rockets. Yikes. Drawing dead. Oh well. 

At the end of the session, I was honestly more bummed I was done playing, not that I lost the money. I really had a great time even with the outcome.

Well I hope any of you who chose to read this found it slightly entertaining or relatable. Please feel free to share any study recommendations with me as I will be needing a lot of extra work before I go try that again.

Or feel free to roast me. It’s totally fair. I heard the Eagles need a new punter.",1604354729
9047,P2P trustless heads up poker on Ethereum without rake,poker,"
I’m a developer with the mission to make a no nonsense open source and peer to peer poker application using Ethereum smart contracts. Particularly I hope to bring these properties to poker players: no rake, tokens are only in escrow while you are sitting at a table (automatic and immediate withdrawls), no trusted third party (just a smart contract), potentially no need to create an account at all. Just sit down play poker with tokens and then leave with your tokens (which can be sold on the open market). 

The only fees are Ethereum gas fees when starting and ending a game. Technically two players could open connections to each other directly (p2p) and play command line to command line (but in practice most people would use the web application with a  modest poker graphical interface). This is all made possible by combining “state channel“ smart contract technology with “mental poker” cryptographic primitives (for those who know about cryptography and blockchain). A fair poker game run completely by the players (and a smart contract that adjudicates) is finally possible. It should exist!

 There are a lot of projects attempting similar things but none of them seem to be up and running, I don’t know a place where we can actually play poker without a trusted third party today. A lot of the blockchain gaming projects seem to be trying to roll out an entire suite of casino games and a big platform, not just poker specifically. Also as far as I understand they all want to charge rake and thus need gaming licenses (this is what seems to be holding up virtue poker for instance) or they need to be hiding from the law. 

My idea is to simplify complexity a lot by focusing only on heads up play at first, and not charging a rake. This way we can ship a modest MVP to mainnet quickly and just grow/develop from there, with feedback from real players. My questions are: Is this something people are looking for, would try out? Does only offering heads up tables massively reduce interest (for you)? What are the legal implications for me as a developer even if there is no rake whatsoever on games?",1604351864

We're getting a great price, and I have the heart blocker.  But, there's no way V is jamming with 2 pair once there's 4-to a straight out there.  There are some natural bluffs, namely 9T and clubs, but I don't think this type of villain jams with all of these type of hands.

9059,Playing Crypto Poker on Tony G's favourite platform for free!,poker,"So I'll precede this by saying I don't work for any of the websites that follow, nor do I have any vested financial interest in their success/failure/commercial activity. I will be sharing how to do this using my own referral links below, but I'm sure that anyone who tries this will agree that this is a fair shout. I'll get to the point.

1) Sign up for Coinbase, they don't require any payment method for an account. This website is the biggest and arguably the safety altcoin exchange on the web. Coinbase have the option to earn relatively significant amounts of Crypto by learning about and (they hope) selling you the idea of several altcoins. These don't take long to complete and in the end you end up with roughly $35 or so in a variety of altcoins.

2) Send these coins to your crypto wallet. Ensure your wallet can convert these for a decent fee into USDT, ETH or BTC. Or move them to your favourite exchange, swap them over for either USDT, ETH or BTC, then transfer to your wallet.

3) Sign up with CoinPoker - CoinPoker is a crypto based poker site with fairly decent rakes. Some of the biggest names (the biggest being Tony G) have been involved in creating and promoting the site. Its interface is half decent and the deposits and withdrawals I have found to be fast (considering this is all done with crypto). Now deposit your converted crypto, as I say I ended up with around around $35 completely free doing this. I've not entered any personal info other than email accounts to do this.

If you want to help me out you can do this using my own referral links, but it will work fine without doing that absolutely no pressure. I just thought I'd share this with the community here as I couldn't believe it worked when I did it yesterday afternoon:

9060,Studying and ranges?,poker,"I guess this is a two-parter.  There are players who spend varying amounts of time studying hands they were involved in, and the like. For people who study Poker off the table, how do you do it?  How much time do you devote to it?  If you’ve been doing it for a while, I would presume that you seen benefits from it. If so, how so?

The other part of my question has to do with ranges.  I’ve been chastising myself for not being more definitive about ranges, of different sorts, related to position, etc. I recently read a number of threads on the subject, from different forums. The consensus was that it was folly to get too hung up on trying to memorize ranges, that the real issue is the table dynamics, that having some preconceived range will simply get in your way.  But what about having a sort of generic ranges, for a typical table, low to mid stakes.  I would think that one could adjust the range given the type of players, and several other factors.  So, for those who have constructed ranges, how did you do it? Is there a source someone could recommend with specific ranges?

For what it’s worth, I usually play 3-5, $500 max buy in. But I also play lower stakes, if I see a table full of bad players giving a lot of action.  About 20% of the time, I will play 5-5, $1000.",1604337683

9075,Thoughts on this river sizing?,poker,"MGMNH $1/3. Just sat down a couple orbits ago and have bumped up to $675 after stacking a player with Kings as the PFR. Villain is unknown young white guy and effective stack with about $400.

Folds to villain on the button who opens to $15. Hero is in BB with AsJd and defends.

Flop is 8s2s2d. Villain continues for $15, we continue thinking that he can c-betting a super wide range here and be opening worse aces than ours from the button and we also have the spade blocker. 

Turn is 9s and villain continues for $25. Sensing some level of weakness from this smallish sizing, we decide to rep the flush and put in the raise to $100.  Looking to fold out a lot of his random 9s and overpairs. In retrospect I probably could have gone a hair bigger here as he's still getting a somewhat reasonable price. Still, I think a call would strengthen his raise considerably and so we are planning to x/f nonspade rivers. Villain mini-tank calls. 

River is 4s. There is basically a PSB behind and we shove the remaining $270. We get snapped by 99. GG, whatever. My question is whether the shove makes sense here. My rationale is there aren't a lot of boats – basically 7 combos that beat me – but I think there can be a lot of K and Q high flushes that  sigh call. Especially from a button open, I feel like he can have like 10ish combos of K6s+ here and maybe like Q9s+, not to mention 6 combos of QQ and KK with a spade. I feel like that makes the shove worth it, even if you assume he's folding all his baby flushes and the rare random trips. But I could also see an argument that hey, he CAN have boats here so I don't really have a nuts advantage and he can also have a bunch more baby flushes rare trips or even a sticky 89 that will maybe call off like $100 here but are never paying off a shove.

So basically I'm curious on the river sizing, as this is a question I tend to struggle with – how to determine when villain is likely enough to have a holding that can pay off a big bet versus when I should forego big money and just steal a little more value.",1604322085

I went up like 5 or 6 buy ins in one day.

One hand in particular I floped a set with TT flush completed on turn, straight completed on river. Guy bet full pot on river (not all in but still large) I folded and showed my tens and he showed K9 for the flush. I love him for showing that hand.",1604318316
9077,How do you know if you're good at poker?,poker,"I can't be the only one who thinks about this. 

I feel like I have good runs and bad runs. Often it feels like I either lose a lot or win a lot. 

I've been playing online for about 11 years. After learning statistics a few years back I've been playing a better game. Took some of the emotions out of it. (Like before I'd assume people were bluffing way too often,now I'm more focused on my own cards. )

Recently I've started studying poker more, using preflop chards,thinking about hand rankings ect. And I feel like it improves my game butI still have bad days where I can't seem to win anything.

Over the years I've spend a couple of hundreds of dollars and I never took money out. Always played low stakes.

Recently I won a ticket to ahigh stakes game, won 600  dollars and took out the most of it. That was such a satisfying feeling.

I'm studying at uni and I'll of course never drop out to play poker but I still have this fantasy that I might have the potential to make some serious money playing poker. Especially since getting in the money at the high stakes tournament.

9081,Partly bitching partly bragging.,poker,"So I don't play a ton of tournaments, but there was a pretty big tournament series here in Houston this week, so I took off work to play a few events. The main event was a multiflight 125,000 gurantee.  I played the Saturday 6pm event and was able to advance to the finals Sunday. I went in to the day not really to short stacked with about 340,000 chips and the big blind being 5,000 with a 5,000 BB ante, and 40 minute levels. We started about 20 people away from the money with quite a few short stacks so I was in pretty good position to make a run. We get down to 32 people and I wake up with pocket Aces! I raised to 20,000,  and get shoved over the top. I obviously make the call and I am up against KK. The flop comes a K, and I lose about 60,000 chips. The very next hand I wake up with AK suited and raise to  20,000, a highly aggressive woman makes 65,000. I make the move all in she calls with pocket 10's. No help that costs me almost all my chips.The big blind hits me, its a raise I fold. This is where it gets really interesting is if I go out 32, I cash for 600, but if I move up to 1 place I make 890 and the payout stays the same for 10 places. I am in the small bline with 13,000 chips, the small blind is 3500. So I decide to fold pretty much every hand, and hope someone gets busted by the time it comes back around, and increase my pay out by 1/3. I look down at my hand and pocket KK. Well, I cant fold that, someone goes all in, I call. Im against 99, flop good, he turns a set. I went from over average stack, to out in 4 consecutive hands..... Dreams dying on the table.. It was a great tournament series though as I cashed all 3 events, and got 2nd place in the deepstack, and 2nd place in the 6 max! I am mostly a cash game player, but the tournaments were amazing to me!!",1604304837

9084,SPR question in PLO when holding AAxx,poker,"So I straddle for $10 in my local 2/5 PLO game. I am $1100 deep. There are a few limpers, then the button (competent player with $750 behind) makes it $50, I pot to $175, everyone folds but the button who calls. 

I have AAQJ (no suit). Flop is 3c6c7h. Pot is $395. Button has $575 behind. 

His range is pretty wide since when he raises to $50 he realizes he is getting odds to call and stack aces (which he probably thinks I always have, even though I don't always have). 

Here is the key moment in the hand........The SPR is 1.46. I decided to check, mainly because I was unsure what to do, button bets $225. I decided to pot (hoping I still had equity). 

I run into 45Ax (lol) and am dead to running boat.

9100,Pot Odds and Equity,poker,"I want to create a thread that explains this in detail. I sometimes get confused by what odds are, what your equity is, what is +EV play.. how does implied odds and reverse implied odd come into the picture etc. 

Here is what I understand. Please feel free to correct me and or add related concepts underneath. 

Pot odds: 

It's a simple risk-reward ratio.. if the pot is $100 and Villain bets $50, you have to call $50 to win $150. So your pot odds are 150:50 or 3:1. 

In other words, you need to win this pot 1 out of 4 times to break even in the long term. 

Or, you are getting 25% pot odds. 

Equity:

In a nutshell, these are your chances of winning the hand. At the river, when the hands are already made, you can assess your hand compared to villains range and compute your chances of winning.. 

On the flop, you can compute this based on 'outs' or cards needed to make a hand. For example a suited hand with two cards of the same suit on the flop (flush draw) has about 36% equity on the flop. If the turn is a blank, the equity now falls to about 18%. 

EV: 

Expected value. The idea to make money in poker is to keep making +EV decisions in the long run. It is basically ...

( Amount win * win % ) - ( amount lose * loss % ) 

These can be computed for various scenarios off the table for studying. 

At the table, is it OK to say if your equity &gt; pot odds, it is a + EV play ? Are there any drawbacks to this assumption ? 

Implied odds:

If you are drawing to the Nuts, it just means that even if you make borderline calls which might be -ev, if you hot your hand, you can extract much more value out of the hand that might still make it a +ev play in the long run. 

For example, considering all the cards are live and you have an open ended straight draw, your equity is about 32% on the flop. The Villain bets 2x Pot giving you 3:2 odds or 40%. 

As equity &lt; pot odds, it is a -EV play but if you hit your hand, you can extract much more value from the villain. That is implied odds.

Reverse implied odds: 

In the previous example, assume the villain bets pot instead of 2x pot. In this case you are getting 2:1 or 33%. It seems like you have enough equity to call. However, if you do not hit your card, your equity will drop to 16% on turn and then you have to fold to a decent sized bet. 

Is there anything else to this? 

The point of this is to make these concepts clear in my mind and see if I he basics right. 

On this note, are there any free softwares that you guys use that help with studying these scenarios? 

Thanks.",1604268912

Two quick beginner questions on Rake. I play on PartyPoker if that changes anything.

1) For a standard cash game 10NL, let's say by the time we get to the turn the pot is at $3.00. If I then bet $5.00 but the Villain folds, is the rake calculated on $3.00 or $8.00?

2) This is my really dumb question. For Rakeback, is Rake only generated by the winning player? So for PartyPoker when working on Rakeback I assume it's based on hands I win which see cards only? As opposed to hands I lose?

9119,Short stack ($30) 50c- $1 NL Poker Strategy,poker,"Old time Party Poker grinder coming back from long lay off here. Quick history, back in the days the game was soft my occupation was a $1-$2 grinder on Party Poker. I left for many reasons  including burnout, Black Friday, better competition,etc... I started up again on ignition poker since I have a job (security) where I literally sit for 12 hour shifts. This strategy is profitable ( $100-$200) dollars a night playing 3-4 50c - $1 NL tables. Your not going to get rich, but after time it’s a great supplement income considered I’m making $20 an hour (security) and I can sit and play online poker.

This is a quick strategy guide, but playing short stack poker makes the game very simple. PM if you have additional questions. 

1) Sit down with the minimum $30 ( Most players at your table have between $75- $150)

2) Realize your playing a different game than everyone else. Popular poker strategy does not apply to you playing short stack  online.

3) Most hands are won with no flop so you need extreme patient. Think long game. No limping in most cases the higher stacks in late position will always make an attempt to steal the pot. 

4) Target players who always raise- steal pots. Your basically playing only pre flop and don’t have to make tough decisions

5) AA-KK-QQ-AK in early position just call. 75% of the time someone will raise to steal the pot. You call$1 they usually raise $4 now your in great position. You only have $26 left so there is a great chance they will call you down all in. If it’s AA- KK I will usually raise to $8 or $9. With only $21 or so left they will gamble with you and your going going to be in other lead at least 80% of the time. If you get more than 1 caller and someone raises only $3 - $4  re raise all in with AK- AQ- JJ- 10-10 9-9. That’s my cutoff point for shoving all in. It’s conservative, but works for me. If you get 2 re raises before your turn be prepared to lay down JJ 10-10-9-9 AQ  My experience from this situation your probably behind. Your only invested $1 by calling and waiting to shove, lay down 2 re raised pots and only shove AA-KK. Maybe even QQ AK you have to get a feel who’s easing all the time and who is playing tight.

6) When winning all ins or getting your stack at $40 or above leave the table and come back in with the minimum $30. At $40 and above your playing a different game. Remember your probably the only player playing like this at the table. Your frustrating the bigger stacks and putting them in positions they don’t want to be in. They like playing post flop and stealing blinds and this strategy will trip them up.

7) Don’t worry about getting your blinds stolen. Playing 3 tables at once the hands will come to use this strategy. Note, the exception is  wild player who always raises with nothing. You can re raise with lower hands AJ  A-10 99, 88. There is some more advanced thinking here, but not much. PM for specific situations. 

8) If you can get in cheap with any small pair in late position with at least 2 or 3 callers before you try. Hitting a set with a small stack is a fewat way to milk players. Now be prepared someone might try and steal with. $10-$15 bet. Just lay it down it’s only a $1

9)I Sneak In late positions with a few callers before you with the KJ - 10-9  43 suited etc... type of cards. Don’t go heads up with these cards, because with a small stack you don’t want to  make hard decisions with 2nd pair, flush draws, straight draws type of situations. 

10) Don’t steal blinds in late position with marginal hands. You will get called. No one if afraid of your stack and bluffing will not work. Use the small stack to your advantage. Number 1 rule I’ll say it again. Normal poker play will result in you losing not winning. 

11) Play when you have time and don’t force play.  I work a 12 hour shift so I have all the time in the world. 

12)Table searching. This is important. Look for aggressive players who are throwing away there money. If the game is to tight or others are playing short stack get out. Believe me you will find the right table.

In conclusion, this is not going to make you a great player. Post flop play is taken out of the equation. You can do some trapping, but it’s mostly all in and folding. Pls PM for further questions I always appreciate watching a solid short stack player.

UTG (167BB) raises to 3 BB

UTG+1 (140BB) flats

Folds to H in BB (102BB) with Ac3c. Hero says to himself ""7.50 BB in the pot, I need to call 2 BB, I have pot odds of nearly 4:1 and only need just over 25% equity to call, I have a suited ace and a wheel draw. Seems fine."" and calls. Pot is 9.75 BB.

Flop is Qc5c2s. Hero checks as he does with all his hands here. UTG leads out for 8 BB, UTG+1 calls. H looks at this situation and says ""There are now nearly 26 BB in this pot. This is an awkward spot for me since folding with a nut flush draw+wheel gutshot seems disasterous, calling seems like a poor way to realize my equity, and any amount I raise to will leave me pot committed. Worst case scenario, one of my opponents has a set, I'm a 3:1 dog. If I raise to a reasonable amount like 20-25BB, and one of them jams, I will need to call 70-75BB to win a pot of ~200BB. (26+25+70+70). This is a profitable call against all sets and bluffs."" In the end, I decided raising with the intent of calling a jam was the only real option, and sure enough was shown a set of 2s. The turn was a 2, and I was drawing dead, so his rivered 2 didn't really matter too much.

I can't help but feel like I somehow talked myself into making a move that was technically correct but too risky and aggressive. The second he jams I obviously know I'm behind, even to a queen.",1604207681

Why does the pot go entirely to Player 2?

I looked up the rules on PokerStars and it says, ""In the event of a tie: Highest pair wins. If players have the same highest pair, highest second pair wins. If both players have two identical pairs, highest side card wins.""

The board has the highest side card at 7, so to me it should be split.  Or if it isn't getting split, it should go to Player 1 for having a higher card in hand.",1604195896

9134,"Dealing with variance in poker (11 session losing streak). How do you cope, mentally?",poker,"I have done really well in poker the last 2 years. However, I've had a 11 game streak of losing sessions (-$14k) in live 1/3 games (deep). In terms of cash value it's not going to bust me since I have other assets well in excess of 14k, but holy crap, 11 cash game loss streak is BRUTAL. I only ever had a 3 or 4 loss streak in like 70sessions.

It makes me question everything about my game. Basically the last 11 sessions has been non-stop
- value betting turn with v.strong hands and getting raised by players who are never bluffing
- value betting river and getting raised or check raised EVERY time (e.g. KK on Q5222) and running straight into A2 lol 
- squeezing AK to $140 and getting 2 callers, and being out of position on a Axx boards when they always have Aces up and raise you on the flop
- flopping sets and players having straights or flushes by the river
- bricking EVERY draw
- getting AA or KK on straddles and getting walks, which never happens to anyone else
- raising broadway cards in MP, getting multiple callers in juicy pots and flop is always 678 or 899 or 443 lol. 
- c-betting the 443 board and players calling me with 56 and turning straights all day long 
- all ins on turn vs. short stacks with top-two, and players about to muck, then realizing they made backdoor flushes for 1.6k pots lol
etc. etc.

Any advice from anyone who has suffered the same downswings? Did you take a week off? Buy a lucky charm? Buy a new pair of underwear? Play in a different cardroom for a while?

So if I bet KK, QQ, KQ, 66, AK intending to triple of brick runouts with maybe JT without clubs, bet a lot of flush draws with all of Ac offsuits intending to triple flush runouts, what am I going to check call if someone starts barreling? Maybe I should have checked AT an AJ of clubs to have some flush draws in my checking range? Should I have a check raising range?

9151,So live poker is finally back but hey wtf,poker,"I was playing some 1/2 in local casinos before it all started. Friday and Saturday night I was there, having great time, breaking even most of the times. Then the pandemic happened and I turned myself to online action, lost decent amount, went down on limits, started to read a little and in a few months was pretty confident playing 25nl. I couldn’t wait till casinos open since I realized if I’m ok playing 25nl I should be fine doing 1/2. So here it is, Lovely Borgata with 30 tables and 7 seats welcomes me back. I jumped at 1/3 and was pretty excited but after 50 hours in 5 days I was pretty frustrated. Live action kind of sucks, at least right now. All these guys just limp call, it’s always 4-6 ppl seeing the flop, you can’t really play ranges or position, you can only win if you have a hand. Then after losing this way it’s getting pretty tilting and the game is so slow it just doesn’t make sense to sit there for ages waiting for hand and losing it again to some random 85s. 
It’s funny cause I can’t really say how it was before since I put a lot of hours online and can’t really remember if I was playing just like they are now. Maybe 50 hours I spent at the tables isn’t enough to make any conclusion but I really can’t see myself doing it for more. Yes you can make a hand and shove nice pot once in a blue moon but sitting for ages and seeing 20 hands per hour seems just like a waste of time. 
I’m pretty positive 2/5 pool has better players where actions make sense but I don’t have bankroll to jump at those games. 
So yeah looks like online is a way to go at least for me and at least for now unless you guys have any idea or advice.

UTG shows Ad4d (two pair)
MP shows Js10s (gut shot straight draw, back door flush draw) 

River Jh 

giving hero nut flush. As the pot is pushed towards me, UTG is befuddled, he can’t believe he lost. I mean shocked. He asks aloud, “what just happened? No, seriously, what was that?” While looking at me. I don’t respond. After another few moments he gets up and asks for a table transfer. I’m still stacking my chips and I hear him say, “ I feel like I’m owed an apology.” 

I half way thought he was joking. But I finish stacking the chips and l look up and see that he is standing up about to walk away, and is waiting for me to apologize. I look around the table thinking is this guy serious? And rather than get into it with I him mutter a half hearted “sorry bro”. He leaves. 

Over the next 30 min villain 2 then complains about the hand. Not being overly insulting, but kind of insinuating that I made a bad play. Eventually letting it go. 

Side note that his is a very splashy 1/3, mostly LAGs. Standard preflop raise with no limpers is 18-23. 

My reasoning is that if I call the $125, I’ll have $150 back and if I hit my card I wont get paid off by MP, who I believed was on a draw. I thought that any heart or king gives me the pot, maybe even a 10. If I miss no big deal, I have another bullet ready to go, this is a fun table.

9160,Is it etiquette to choose to refrain from hitting and running or is it just something looked down upon by people that care?,poker,"Helllo community. I have a question since I have been seeing it quite often at my local card room at lucky chances in Colma, CA. People love to hit and run here especially the 3/5 players who sit down at  the 1/1/2 game and play a few hands win a huge pot and switch to the 3/5 game. I understand that most of the time this is due to timing of when their 3/5 seat is open but I see this done by many people who are not 3/5 players as well. I know hitting and running is quite frowned upon by many people who play live poker and vloggers even talk about it and record people doing it to them in their videos. A local vlogger who plays at LC even mentions that he stays for a bit after he wins a big pot to avoid hitting and running. Obviously I understand that in live poker, people are free to leave tables, switch tables, or stop playing as they please. I also try not to hit and run as well to be considerate of whenever I do win a big pot that I am not just cashing out after that hand. So yeah do you consider not hitting and running etiquette or just something looked down upon. Because when I see it so often at LC, I am not going to lie it pisses me off.

**Preflop:** Folds to Villain (SB). Villain raises to $0.20. Hero (BB) calls with **8s8h**

**Flop ($0.40) - 8d Js 7h**

Villain bets $0.15. Hero calls.

Flop middle set, things are looking great. At this point I think he might be on some sort of straight draw or maybe even just an unpaired Ace. Villain's typically opening pretty wide from the SB. Maybe the 4x sizing should've thrown me off ever so slightly since 3x is the most common open size at these tables, but I think that's being really nit picky.

**Turn ($0.70) - Qd**

Villain bets $0.60. Hero calls.

The Queen technically makes the board straightier, but doesn't actually help him get there. If I thought I was good on the flop, then I should still be good here. The really large sizing definitely polarizes his range, and some of that could be JJ, QQ but in the moment that never even crossed my mind.

**River ($1.90) - Qh**

Villain bets $1.07. Hero raises to $3.10. Villain shoves to $4.05. Hero calls the rest.

9163,Exploitative vs GTO - Why you need to learn both to be a decent player.,poker,"GTO vs Exploitative, which is better?

To me, there is a simple answer to this question. Both! Understanding GTO and Exploitative play is necessary to becoming a decent poker player. For those of you who don't know what each are, I'll give a brief summary of each and why people tend to argue over this topic.

GTO, aka Game Theory Optimal - Perfect play that cannot lose, computers have solved poker and GTO is the answer they give. Let's be clear on one thing, if you are playing perfect GTO poker you cannot lose. It's fundamentally, mathematically impossible.

Exploitative - Imperfect play that takes advantage of other player's mistakes. Any change in your normal play based on information gathered from your opponent can be considered exploitative. For example, if someone is calling too much you would bluff less and bet for value more.

Problems with both - The problems with Exploitative are simple and easy to understand. Any time you make a move that is not GTO, you are open to counter exploitation. Perfect GTO cannot be exploited whereas exploitative can be. At a glance it seems like GTO is the better of the two. I mean, if it can't lose than how can it be worse than exploitative? The problem with GTO is twofold. The first is a human one. We are not computers, so execution of perfect GTO play is impossible. You can study all you want, use randomizers, memorize charts, and you still will not execute perfect GTO play. The second problem is that you are also potentially not winning as much as you could be if you had played exploitatively. This is often referred to by players as, ""leaving money on the table."" Furthermore, anytime you make a play that is not perfect GTO you are potentially losing money.

Argument in a nutshell - GTO says exploitative is bad because they are open to counter exploitation whereas exploitative says GTO is bad because you cannot play perfect GTO, also because you are potentially not winning as much as you could be. However, I would argue that both schools of thought work better together and you actually need an understanding of both to be a decent poker player.

Why GTO needs Exploitative -Since you cannot play perfect GTO, you need some way to make up the money you have lost from making small mistakes. A great GTO player is still making mistakes. They may be small mistakes but they are mistakes. These mistakes lead to lost money. So the most obvious answer to me is to play exploitatively to make up for the money lost by the mistakes you have made playing close but not quite perfect GTO poker.

Why Exploitative needs GTO-  Exploitative works by leveraging your opponents mistakes. But how can you know what a mistake is if you do not understand GTO? Without understanding GTO solutions, it is impossible to accurately exploit your opponents.

9192,overthinking or right fold?,poker,"Played this hand at a $1/2 home game, so Villain is a TAG player who is capable of making big bluffs when he sees the opportunity. 

Villain open UTG to $8, I called with KhJs at MP and 2 more callers behind. 
Flop came 10d Jd Qh, Villain C-bet $24, I call and button call. 
Turn came 9s, Villain check, I bet $30 only Villain call. 
River came 7s, Villain check, I sized down to $50 hoping Villain would call it off with all the top pairs/two pairs/sets, Villain tanked for about 2minutes and shoved $200. I tanked for minutes, couldn't think of a hand that would play this way other than AK trapping the turn and river, so I folded. 
My logic is: 
1. If he just had the K, its more likely that he would lead the turn or the river, and even if he trapped both street, he would just call my river bet as nothing except AK/K can call his shove anyway (we play together every week, most of the obvious chop board i.e. four to a straight, double paired board,   he would just snap call my river bet and take the chop, so very unlikely he was trying to push me off a chop as well).
2. If he had AK here and put me on a K/flush draw on the turn, trapping the river makes a lot of sense, I'm 100% betting my K and I sometimes bluff missed flush draw here when he showed weakness. 
3. It's pretty obvious that I have a K here, so I don't think anyone at this stake is crazy enough to try to bluff off a K at this spot, as most people never folds here. 

So what do you guys think, is my logic flawed here? or did I overthink and should have just called it off with second nuts at this spot?",1604089193

Tonight I was feeling brave and played a $5 MTT which is way bigger stakes than I usually play. It's only $5 I know, but I knew I would be entering a much stronger player base than I am used to playing against.

I double up on about hand 5 having been given pocket aces (what a gift). About another 5 hands later I lose most of my stack playing pocket kings, having hit a set on the flop to someone playing A5 spades (mid pair fives on the flop ... flop was something like K,5,3) but it is the king of spades on the flop and you guessed it, they hit runner spades for the flush with no paired board and I am gutted. But I manage to keep my composure and play solid poker over the next 2 hours and end up cashing 9th out of 74! A relatively min cash by the standards here I know, but I am really happy with my performance.

I couldn't have done that a few months a go. Not losing my buy in is good, but even better is feeling like I could hold my own against the field.

I just wanted to share. I feel like tonight was a sign of my progress paying off.

The hand: 

My stack: $450-ish

Pick up JJ in UTG, raise to $15 (these games play very large, $15-25 pre-flop raises are typical). 

UTG+1 calls. MP re-raises to $60. I think for a bit and call(basically thinking I really need to hit a set here to be good). UTG+1 calls as well. 

Flop is J 8 4 (two diamonds)

Why would I do this..? I definitely got WAY too excited and royally screwed up and missed ANY value I was going to get from this hand.

9292,Poker bankroll management weird spot,poker,"Hi,

I am quite new to poker but want to take it really seriously. I have been playing for a bit more than a month in NL2 trying to build a bankroll and jump stakes. The thing is, I am from Spain and play in a French poker site called winamax (maybe you know it given that it sponsors players like Guilleaume Diaz and Adrián Mateos) and this site has a kind of ""Bingo"" where, if you get 16 randomly determined cards of the deck over 50 hands an odd number of times, you get a money prize (in my case 33€).

Yesterday, after 50k hands, I won it, which really surprised me since I never gave it so much importance. The thing is, I was planning on adding it to my bankroll, but I would not like it to be any kind of shortcut. On the other hand, given that I have 55€ in winnings and 130€ in rake, I can also see it as a rakeback system.

What do you guys think would be wiser?

If anyone is courious, I study statistics at uni and calculated the probability of getting the bingo with a professor help, being it something like one every 88k tries (at 50 hands the try, it would usually take 4M hands to get it). But, being fair Im a horrible student so it might aswell be wrong.

1. Do you use the maths in every hand? I really enjoy learning the maths of poker, but feel like in session I just don’t have enough time to do it. They’re not like easy pots like 10 into a 20 pot, so I struggle to figure it out properly. Do you just automatically know your pot odds, equity, BE% and EV of your hands?

2. Do you feel like your time studying the game reflects in your play? I don’t by all believe I’ve even come close to understanding this game completely, so I’m just wondering if far more seasoned players than myself can sort of feel all their time studying in session. 

3. What’s the most important things I should be nailing down? Maths? Pre-flop play? I have a working knowledge now of most aspects of the game, and wanna know where my time would be best spent really honing some aspect of the game. 

4. It can be pretty demoralising to spend 1/2 hours a day studying poker, yet feeling like in my sessions I’m always losing. How do you stay motivated? I know that even the best poker players aren’t gonna win every hand, but how do I start improving my win rate?

I've put in hundreds of hours studying poker and have been coached in the past at these higher stakes.

About a month or so ago I started college and decided to withdraw my entire bankroll (tuition is a bitch) besides $100 and just play 5,000 hands a week of 5nlz and build a new roll out of that. 

Little did I know I'd be down 20 buy-ins after just 50k hands. It just seems like however I play, whatever strategy I take up, I can't for the life of me make any profit at what should be the softest pool in online poker. 

I play a solid TAG strategy of 22/18 and it just doesn't work. The amount of bad beats I receive is inconceivable. I just played a 1.5k hand session and ran \~800bb below in EV.

According to equilab , my odds to win in the showdown vs hands susceptibles to call me (I've imagined a villain with all the Qs and another with JTs and Jto) are 43.70% .

So according to those odds , was it a mistake to bet on the flop , esp since i'm 2nd to talk ? Or was it right , because multiple people calling make a nice big pot , and for protection ?",1603923549

Games is 1/2 no limit with a full ring (nine handed) So I’m in the cutoff and I pick up Jacks. 3 limpers in front and I open to 11 dollars (a little higher than my usual $6-8 dollar open bc limpers). 2 callers. 

Flop is J-8-5 rainbow. I’ve got a set. Checks around to me, no one looks interested, so I don’t want to blow everyone off the pot. I fire for 20 bucks. 1 caller. 

Turn is a deuce completing the rainbow. No flush draw to worry about. Nothing hurting me there. Villain checks to me and I decide to go for value. I decide to go for a little over 2/3 pot at 75 dollars. Guy calls me again. 

River is a 4. Full board is J-8-5-2-4. He bets into me for 100. I Hollywooded a little but all I was thinking about was Vegas and the effing Mirage. I jam it all in there for around 350.

I know 7-6 could get there, but in my head I kept thinking he could just as easily roll over 4-5, 8s, or 5s.

Lately I'm losing more than winning.

1) In a 9 handed table.. do you 3 or 4bet preflop with suited connectors like 67, 89? If flop has an A and rainbow... and betting on  flop and you get called and turn is just blank... do you fire again or assume that villain simply just has a weak ace? Against a calling station... just give up? Against a smart player... keep firing and hope that they fold?

2) With a hand like 10J... and facing a NIT big raise... do you simply call?

3) Can you ever fold KKs to the biggest nit on the table that hasn't played all night and out of nowhere goes all in? 200bb+ deep?

9347,AKo or AKs ? such a trap!,poker,"Hi guys,

In a cash game say 1/2 or 1/3:

Say, you are 200-300bb deep. And there is a raise + re-raise. And then it's up to you.

With AKo or AKs would you call, 5 bet or go all in? In what scenarios would you do one or the other?

IF you do decide to 5 bet and get one caller. And say the flop is Q 10 3 rainbow or any other flop.. Would you go bet/shove on the flop either IP or/and OOP?

Recently, I have lost 2 massive pots (over $1000) with AK. And I'm just trying to understand how to play better with AKo and AKs",1603895581

9357,Poker and your health,poker,"Everything you do in life has at least a subtle effect on your health. Poker is no different, both with benefits and drawbacks. Today, I'll boldly try to answer the question scientists are struggling with - is poker good for the brain?

## A Professional Mind

On the one hand, poker demands exceptional focus, analysis, computation, and even people skills, all of which will work those brain muscles.

The intellectual and creative game stimulates the brain. There's even a theory that playing poker creates new neurological pathways in the brain, ultimately letting cells transmit information more efficiently.

Plus, players with many games under their belts develop patience, focus, discipline, and emotional control. These skills help stress-management outside the table.

Finally, playing with people is good for you. Even if you go for [video poker online](https://casinocanada.com/games/video-poker/), you still reap the benefits of socializing.

## What About Stress?

On the other hand, there's the increasingly stressful environment of our everyday lives, further exacerbated by tense games. 

Anxiety can hurt your mind and body, even with those advanced stress-management skills. The lifestyle also harms the brain if your sleep suffers. 

Overall, as long as you make sure your lifestyle stays balanced, poker can do wonders for your brain.",1603877573

9367,Curious about my line on a bluff,poker,"Haven’t been playing very long (3 months) but have been putting in a lot of hours and studying as much as I can.
I’m trying to understand different board textures and bluffing candidates / frequency right now. I took an aggressive route recently for a bluff and was curious to know if it’s a good or bad line to take every once in a while, or just a bad play in general.

Hand:
Just sat down and it’s online, so little information on other players or me

Kh Kd 2c 

Hero bets $4.5 into ~$13.5
V calls

Turn 8d 

Hero bets $7.5 into ~$22
V calls

River 10h

Hero jams for ~$29 into ~$37
V calls shows QQ


My thoughts:
I pretty much put him on 
AQdd
AJdd
KQ (4)
KJ (4)
QJdd
TT (3)
88,99,JJ (18)
Maybe QQ but likely 4betting 

Losing to every hand, but I chose to jam vs smaller sizing because I wanted to put pairs in a tough spot since I figured it would be hard to call a jam against a lot of aggression.

My questions:
-Assuming that I don’t do this every time (I typically wouldn’t), is this an okay line with bottom of range here if trying to structure a proper bluff?
-Should I ever expect QQ to fold here?
-If this is a bad bluff attempt, what are some better candidates, and what are some things I should be considering? 

Like I said, I’m pretty new to poker so I’m okay with this being a bad line, just didn’t want to be results oriented if it was an okay play",1603848584

9369,Warning to aspiring Poker players. Truths from an ex-pro. Also about online poker rigged,poker,"Other than full time professionals, bots, colluders, etc, people estimate only 0.5% of people profit long term from Poker. At the end of the day it is Gambling. Never forget that. Here's the story of my friend who is an amazing guy, hardest working guy I know, and how he got treated with Poker.

My friend lost $10,000 playing online poker, despite going to college on a full ride for advanced math that I'm not even capable of understanding. At first I was skeptical, and then he sent me his 150,000 hand history. My friend had a 24% win rate with pocket Kings in showdowns, 22% overall. He also had less than a 50% win rate with Queens and Aces. I sat down with him for a few of his sessions, since I was the one who got him into poker. I sat by, feeling super guilty, as he got coolered and river rivered roughly 70-80% of the time, when the chance of this stuff happening is about 4-20%.

So if you're a losing player online, and you've come to these forums and hear the 'success stories' lots of these shills or braggers say... just realize it's not the entire truth. 

The truth about variance is... the same way a Royal Flush is a 1 in 650,000 chance, you can simply be a losing player for 650,000 hands, no matter how you play. Variance has no guarantees. 

Something Poker players don't like to let the new community realize is, Poker is just gambling with a side of bluffing. At the end of the hand, you either have the cards, or you don't. You will eventually get called no matter how clever you are. Phil Ivey lost $10+ million playing basic rooms online. Daniel Negreanu and Doug Polk are both losing players online, even at microstakes. 

Now, if you search Online Poker Rigged on google, you'll get about 650,000 (royal flush odds, ironic!) pages and testimonials of people saying online poker is rigged. Then you'll get the waves of people coming at them, calling them stupid donkeys, etc. My friend is one of the most disciplined and smart people I have ever known. He went to college on a full ride, apparently makes 6 figures right out of graduation. 

Got his house at 24 years old. We were best friends in high school, so I was having a lot of fun with poker and decided to get him into it. I actually told him, because of how guilty I feel about his online poker experience, that I'm going to personally pay off the $10,000 he lost online. During the two sessions I sat down with him, things were happening that just cannot be explained. I'm talking runner runners in 80% of his hands during a 6+ hour session. 

If you are new to poker, or think you are getting close to that skill level to being a professional, just know it won't last. Phil Ivey, considered NUMBER ONE in the world at one point, was 'losing' online to no-name regulars at mid-stakes. He no longer plays online. 

Moral of the story. The same way people win the lottery, or run good... someone can run the opposite. There's the exact same chance of running bad continously, in fact it's higher because you are at a table with 2-9 other people. Doyal Brunson won the world series of Poker 2x in a row donking out using trash hands like 10-2 offsuit. Someone said that Doyal didn't even know the math for open ended straight odds when he won. Can you imagine that? Losing to someone who doesn't even know gradeschool math because he donked out with 10-2, a hand that is ""negative equity"". 

Don't get fooled by incels, shills, coaches, who gaslight you and try to make you feel bad. Eric, if you're reading this, I'm sorry I got you into online poker. Glad you quit when you did. I will pay off the $10,000 you lost with pride. 

Go watch the world finals of Poker in 2018, and 2019. A guy with a neckbeard punts 33 into JJ and runner runners a straight. Same neckbeard guy appears in the final table, where he flops a full house and then Quads to 'win' the tournament.",1603844440

9376,"1st time at a ""casino"" NL 1-2",poker,"So this past Sunday I was out with my friends and watched the pathetic Patriots game where I ended up a little intoxicated. The bar we were at had a ""casino"" and poker room in the back and figured I would kill some time while I sobered up. Grabbed 300 cash from the ATM and wandered around until I found the Poker host and asked for a seat at a 1-2 table.

As this was my first time playing a live cash game outside of a few friends at a home game I was quite nervous. I have played a few bar tournaments but never cash.  Wasn't sure how to get chips, a seat, or what I should even be doing. 

I was brought to a table with an open seat (6 max full with me) and got 200 in chips. I figured I would have money left to add on or rebuy if things went how I expected them to.  

The first hour was brutal. I sat down at what would have been the small blind but opted to wait until the button passed me, plus I wanted to observe the players for a little bit before joining in the fun. The first thing I noticed is people were opening 7.5x the blinds, I was NOT ready for this.  I folded through until I was the BB where the person in the cut-off (Old guy, no hand had reached the river yet) opened to 15 which seemed to be the standard open so far, had around 3-4 hundred in a messy stack, fold to me. Looked at AJ hearts. I considered raising but didn't want to have  limited maneuverability on following streets, call.
Flop Kc Tc 8d
I checked, CO bets 55, I fold.

A few more flops and nothing has hit, starting to get a feel for the table. I slowly watch my stack dwindle to about 120. Person 2 to the right is a LAG reg who visibly shook his head at me when I folded my first hand. Old guy was clearly TAG and wouldn't play anything but mid-high pairs and suited A8+ and AQ+ unsuited. Guy to my immediate left was a solid reg with about 700 in front of him and very talkative. The others at the table were either inexperienced or complete degens. I at least knew who I was going to target if I was going to come out ahead.
Some weird things coming from playing tourneys to cash was watching people split the pot pre SB/BB. I guess I was being a dick when people folded to me in the SB and I kept raising into the big stack? Dealer changes seemed very rapid, every 20-30 minutes or so.  Also felt weird watching people call over for more chips. 

All in all a fun time, wish I had more opportunities to play.",1603838279

9382,A Poker Story,poker,"Like many of you, I was a product of the Moneymaker affect. I started studying poker in 2003, and began playing online on Full Tilt. I turned $50 into $4,250 in a very short time playing MTTs, and after that I was hooked. I ended up having to withdraw my online bank roll in order to buy a car for college. I was in the process of building my bankroll again when Black Friday happened. 

I suffered from anxiety and depression for years, and the thought of playing live intimidated me, i'll admit. I'm also a poor white boy from rural Ohio, and never really had the disposable to buy into a live game anyways. 

That all changed in March. I had been saving up a bit for a road trip out west, when COVID happened. I didn't see that as being a real possibility under the current political climate, so I started thinking about poker again. I started playing online, and realized that the game had changed in the 15 years I had been away. I started learning about hand ranges, and EV, ICM. All things that I was aware of before, but had never really thought about. I took a beating at first, and then started to analyze my game. Once I plugged a few leaks in my game, I started cashing in tournaments again, and often. I started building that bank roll again. 

Thats it I thought. I'm going to Vegas. Since it was about the only place in the nation playing live poker. ..but damn. Thats far. So, I saw that the Borgata was opening, and I was ready to head to NJ to ..just see what would happen. I had just watched Rounders, and I was ready to throw my hat into the ring. lol

As I was scouring the internet for ANY poker rooms closer to me than Jersey, I found 'The Shark Tank Poker Club' in Columbus,  Ohio. So, on a whim..i decided to head up. 

I was nervous as hell going in, I admit, but I kept my poker face pretty well. I sat down at a live cash game for my very first time a last week, playing NL1/2. I played extremely tight and just sat and watched, learning the procedure. Everyone talks about how slow live poker is, but to me, i thought it was surprisingly fast (great dealers there). I struggled to follow the action at first, and folded out of turn twice. I apologized to the table, told them I was a greenhorn, and it was no issue. I got a few hands, but didn't play them well because I was not good at counting the pot yet. As the night progressed I started to catch up with what was going on around me, I just went card dead the rest of the night. At the end of my first night, I lost around $150 and chalked it up to a learning experience. I'd had a good time, and I was fine with the loss. I hadn't played my best game, and I knew it. I was ready to get back at it ASAP.

4 nights later. This past Saturday. I showed up again at the Shark Tank. This time I was ready to play my game. I bought in NL1/2 for $300 and told myself if I lost it all, I was just going to re-load and keep firing. 

My 2nd hand of the night. I pick up pocket 5s. In a 3 way pot, the board came 5-6-8. I bet $100 into a $95 pot. One fold, one call. The turn is a 7. Villain goes all in, I call. He shows 10-9. I got stacked my 2nd hand of the night. I had been there 20 minutes and already i am in the hole $300. I have to admit that for a moment, I thought about leaving. I bought in for $200 and got switched tables. I sat down at the new table and bought another $100 in chips. 

Over the next 5 hours I won $1,550. I was stacking people left and right. I sent a brain surgeon to the ATM 3 times. Thats a nice feeling.

As it turns out, the place is full of whales on a Sat. night. Yes, i was getting cards..but I was also getting value. They just..could..not..fold. After I stacked the surgeon for the 3rd time (with AA). I apologized to the table, but that it was time for me to go. I had a 2 hour drive ahead of me and it was 2:30am. I left the table on Aces and 650BB ahead.

Obviously I had a good night, and I'm not going to expect this every weekend..but I will say that it gave me the confidence in my game I needed to keep coming back. I'm not naive enough to think that I will continue to play at 303.5/100BB but I'm definitely willing to give it a try. lol Especially if that surgeon comes back.

I'm sorry to write a novel here, but if there is a moral to my story. I want it to be: take your shot. Go for it. Have confidence in your game. Don't be afraid to re-load and keep firing. 

My dream is to play in the WSOP someday, but if Saturday is the highlight of my career. It was worth it.

Read on villain, as much as it's worth at 25NL: they're playing weak/loose (\~30% of hands, position seems to be irrelevant, limping a lot), hasn't won a pot in like 4 orbits, only shown once to win (that I can remember) in late position with second-best pair. So it's hard to put them on any kind of range. Basically, they're leaking chips and maybe playing whatever feels good?

&gt;!My thinking: Cheap to call with connectors in the BB. Flop: wet board, three-handed, so better bet the straight to make the flush draws pay. Turn: flush draw completes, but I'll bet to see if I'm actually hosed. River: no change, villain didn't raise my turn bet. If I check, villain will definitely bet, which I would probably fold to, depending on sizing. So bet the amount I would have called, or for value in case he didn't have the flush. Obviously fold if I get raised back.!&lt;",1603827770

9429,QQ Facing a Raise w/ Favorable Flop (10NL fast-fold),poker,"Between now and the end of the year, my goal is to post at least three 10NL fast-fold hands per week to get feedback on my play and to facilitate discussion on this sub. I am using random sampling to search my HUD for hands that are either big wins or big losses. So, I might not remember villain specific reads. In other hands, I can construct what is known about a villain from HUD notes. So, in that spirit, here is my line and some discussion questions: 

**Stacks**:  
UTG -      UTG (**131.7BB**)  
**MP      - Hero (135.2BB)**  
CO      - CO (**448BB**)  
BTN      - BTN (**86BB**)  
SB      - SB (**107BB**)  
BB      - BB (**190.8BB**)

**Preflop: Hero is MP** with Q♥ Q♣  
**UTG raises to 3.5BB**, **Hero 3-bets to 12BB**, *4 folds*, UTG calls 8.5BB

**Flop:** J♥ T♣ 3♠ (**25.5BB**, 2 players - 119.7BB effective)  
UTG checks, **Hero bets 9.5BB**, **UTG raises to 52.8BB**

**Reads:** Villain is not a grinder who plays a lot of volume. Villain is the typical microstates regular in that she overplays hands, doesn't understand pot sizing, and calls too wide in certain spots. Villain is not a complete degen who will call down with literally anything.

**Question 1:** Bet sizing - Hero bet 37% on this flop although it was ideal for QQ. There needs to be a price for KQ or 98 while still getting value from AJ, AT, KJ type of hands. Should hero bet more here?

**Question 2:** It seems rare that villain is smooth calling preflop with AA or KK, but JJ and TT, and JT suited seem possible. Occasionally microstakes players may spew with AJ or even AK here. What likely range can we construct for villain?

**Question 3:** Facing a raise that is slightly over pot sized, should hero lay this down? Or, should hero flat or shove? Flatting seems terrible.",1602714897
9430,How to know when to ship it or how much to raise river for value?,poker,"I just played a hand where I had the nut straight, opponent bet flop, checked and bet 75% pot on the river and I raised the river 2.5x, hoping to not scare away any two pair/set type hands

They called and had the lower straight.

I definitely played this like a fish and lost value, I think I could have shipped river and got called.

So my question is, how do you know when to raise big for value and when to raise small? Do you kind of just work it out depending on the hand?",1602713628
9431,Why is online poker ui trying to mimic a real table?,poker,"When playing digitally, there really isn't the need for players to be arranged in a circle.

9443,How much support do you use DURING an online cash game and/or tournament?,poker,"Reading about Negreanu vs Polk earlier and they were arguing about using charts and sheets during a game. I used to worry that online players were using sophisticated solvers during each hand that essentially told them what their opponent had, but then I was told that this wasn't practical. Now I'm not so sure. Sometimes I have a pre-flop positional chart and I feel in the wrong even at that.

9444,Question on playing TT-QQ in 4 bet pots,poker,"What are people's general strategies for playing TT-QQ as the in position caller of a 4 bet when the board runs out low and dry? It often feels like I'm only ever up against better in these spots especially when they continue to barrel multiple streets, but doesn't doing a lot of folding leave us exploitable to AK being turned into a bluff and the A5s types of hands? I play 25nlz on Ignition so you can review hands and see if you were bluffed or not when reviewing hands, and I always feel either super genius when either calling down correctly or making a tight fold with queens or really dumb when I run up against better value.

Obviously I'm more apt to call down with QQ than TT and less likely to call down when I block flush draws that bricked by the river but I guess my question is how to eliminate the expensive guessing game that happens for me at least in a lot of these spots. Keep in mind its an anonymous player pool so really no possible reads than maybe the bigger stacks are better more aggressive players.",1602705460

9455,Don't understand pot odds,poker,"I'm so confused with the way pot odds are calculated. 

Say I have a draw, and the pot is $600 on the turn and a player goes all in for $400, I've always viewed this as $400 to me, to win $1000, so I need (4/10)*100 = 40% equity to break even. Therefore I'd need a draw with at least 18 outs to be profitable (basically always a fold in hold'e; not always in PLO).

But others calculate it as $400 to win $1400, including the $400 I haven't put in yet?. So 28.6% needed. This means a draw of 13 cards would be sufficiently profitable. 

Why in the world is the $400 I haven't put in yet calculated into the equation? All I care about is the $1000 in the middle surely when looking at pot odds. 

Anyone else confused by this?",1602687052

9458,Displaying the stacks as blinds,poker,"Hi,

  does displaying the stacks as a blind amount change a tourney into a race ? Because regardless on how well you are doing your stack keep getting smaller as the blind value mount.   
When your stack is displayed in chip value you don't have the same sense of urgency as your value usually keep growing.  


By example, let's imagine I triple up from 100BB to 300B, next level I am down to only 200BB, while in the same time my stack tripled from 20k to 60k and is still 60k.

9465,Cracking the micro stakes formula.,poker,"Before I turned 18 I used to be a long term winning a mid/lower high stakes player. Because I couldn't make my own account I used other IDs to play.  
Long story short... when I turned 18 the people that I played for ""stole"" all the money from the accounts I used. (not surprising)

Anyway, I had to start at the bottom again. I ran my BR up from 15USD to about 300 pretty quickly and then I started struggling a ton. Bad luck/shitty strategy made me go on a downswing. 

The stuff I will be stating here will probably be obvious for every capable poker player here. Jokes on me for not figuring this out earlier. 

My general playstyle is pretty much LAG. I was so used to playing this way that it only seemed natural to keep on playing this way even at micro stakes. 

LAG playstyle involves making big ass bluffs. 

People at micro stakes are not balanced so they don't have much to fold usually if I make a big (river) bluff. 

Solution:  
Smaller ""bluffs"" (not playing my two cards but my range) is good.  
Making big bluffs without taking into consideration that my opponent is an incapable player = bad.

1-2 NLHE and I straddle for $5 under the gun with $550 behind.  It folds to MP who opens it to $20 and there is one caller on the button.  

With AKo I go ahead and raise it up to $65 and both players make the call.  At this point I'm putting them on middling pocket pairs or a weaker ace.  The MP player only has $75 behind but the button has about $350 left.  

The flop comes 223 rainbow.  I'm first to act and to me this seems like a spot where if I jam any middle pair is gonna have a hard time making the call and any weaker ace is just gonna fold.  

I go ahead and jam all in after debating for a few seconds and the MP folds immediately while the button think for about 5 seconds before calling with pocket 10s.  The board bricks our and he scoops a pretty good sized pot.  

Was this a bad play?  My thought was any player is gonna have a tough time making that call with a middle pair and if I do get called I think my A and K are both live cards to the turn and river.  Is this a bad play or no?",1602647040

**Question 1:** At the micros, what types of hands is a standard villain calling a 3-bet with preflop and then jamming with here on the river? How often does villain have a flush or a set here?

**Question 2:** Hero is only getting 3:2 on this call because the all in jam is almost twice the pot. So, hero needs to be good 2/3 of the time to make this call. Given the obnoxious bet sizing is this an instant muck? The jam seems very nutted with no specific read on this player.

**Question 3:** While leading the flop and turn, hero needs to set a price for a flush draw while still getting value from hands like KQ or KJ. Is hero's bet sizing on the flop (50%) and turn (57%) too light?",1602640023

9489,Offering Cheap Microstakes PLO Coaching,poker,"Hi Reddit,

As the title suggests, I am interested in getting into coaching. Specifically I want to start coaching microstakes PLO as this is a game and population that I am very familiar with, and is also very easy to beat with some guidance. I will range anywhere from .01/.02 to .05/.10. I play higher than that but would not be comfortable coaching. 

Due to my inexperience with coaching and the small stakes I am only looking to charge $15-$20 per hour depending on how many hours someone needs. 

As proof that I'm not a total donk looking to just steal money; I spend the past 7 days and 24.25hrs grinding out 6346 hands at .05/.10 and lower. It's not the biggest sample size but I just wanted to some recent evidence that I can pretty comfortably beat the game. 

Here my graph. https://imgur.com/zDxwV3p

All of that being said, I am not currently looking to take on any paid coaching jobs. I want to offer free coaching to a few people so I can refine my delivery method and training strategies. Is anyone interested? In return for the coaching you will need to give adequate feedback on the quality, delivery etc... of the coaching.",1602630164

We played Texas Hold'em, with blinds that went up with a elimination or when blinds had gone around the table twice. This was all with no money on the line, in fact nothing to win besides bragging rights.

Soon all of us are going to a cabin for two nights and I thought it would be fun to play poker on the first night.

We have never played for cash and I don't really care to because its just among friends. But I do recognize that without anything at stake, the only thing keeping people from being stupid is knowing that if they go out early then they just have to wait around (at a beautiful lake). Also we are all very competitive so we want to beat each other.

What is something we could do to bring some sort of stake into the game? Or should we just go ahead and do a small cash game with like a $10 buy in?",1602619783

9507,Bad Beat or Bad Call?,poker,"I'm still kinda new to live Poker, so I still get a little nervous at the table, to the point that someone watching closely can see my hands shake when I put chips out (someone made note of it). 

So, I have a hand that I think I played right, but wanted some feedback just the same.

$1/3 NL, 6-handed. I bought in max at $400.   
I was up $200, then lost a lot of that profit chasing and paying people off. I take notes of my hands and put in a note that I need to tighten up.

The guy on my left is bit splashy and a bit of a bully. Likes to bet and raise wide, and I picked him off a few times. Guy on my right is loose and passive. 

With the hand in question, I have about $475. The guy to my left has me covered and the guy to my right has maybe $200. I have red 88 in the CO. There are two limps before me, when I make it $12. The Button makes it $40, and the Highjack and myself make the call. 

Flop is AA8. The HJ checks, I bet $75 and the Button goes all-in (covering me and HJ). The HJ thinks for a super long time and makes the call. I don't believe either of them have pocket AA, so I'm not worried about that but is it the right call to call this with two other all-ins?",1602601777
9508,How To Play At 1/2NL Loose-Straddle Limpy-Limp/Call Tables?,poker,"Incredibly common question, I'm sure. But:

**Is there any way to exploit / beat a table like this?**

Almost everyone straddles for $5 on the BTN or UTG. Seemingly every hand, everybody limps in for $5. If someone makes a raise to between $10 - $20, you'll have the majority Limp/Call. They have an ""in for a penny, in for a pound"" mindset. So basically every pot is going multiway, sometimes everybody's in if there was no preflop raise. 

Bigger flop bets can narrow the field to 4 or 3 or sometimes 2. I'd say you have 75/25 from this point who's in for value and who's floating. Almost all showdowns were legit made hands (somebody's gonna catch when it's 7-handed all the time).

After learning the hard way, I just resigned myself to an ultra-tight range &amp; raised small pre-flop to build the pot with these stronger hands (but not break the bank) and would play mostly fit-or-fold on the flop. Not sure how you would make the game ""play through you"" at a table like this.

I'm realizing that this is one of the most common table types I run into, and I need a better plan. Does anybody have any advice for being +EV at these tables?",1602599934

I see this as a sometimes call sometimes fold situation, depending on player info, but even with no reads I’m having a hard time folding a hand like this in position. I’m happy to go to a flop against hands like 99-JJ or AJs. 

Let’s say we call, and we whiff on a dry ace high board (e.g. Ah 9c 3d). BB opts to check and now we’re in a weird position right? Seems unlikely they’d be checking AJ-AK here. And we certainly have AJ-AK in our 3-bet calling range. It’s possible they’re checking hands like TT or JJ here, but also possible they’re checking very strong hands like a set of aces or nines. My question is do we turn our hand into a bluff to try to take down a sizeable pot or do we check behind?",1602595175

It seemed that people were playing very loose but were waking up with the nuts. I just focused on trying to stay tight and play my ranges that I have been studying.

Game: $2/$3 - Spread limit (Max bet $300) - 7 handed

Hero: $645 (roughly), Position: SB

Villain: $900 (roughly), Position: UTG

UTG limps for $3, folds to the button who limps for $3.  I am in the SB with QdQs and I raise to $43 ($40 on top of the $3 bb). UTG calls and button folds. The pot is now $87.

Flop: Jh 9d 5c

I open for $25 and the UTG player raises to $105.  I think for a good amount of time trying to figure out what he could be on and I settled on pocket jacks or Kings/Aces. I call

Turn: 5h

I check and he bets $300. I go in the tank again and try to re-think through what he could have.  Kings and Aces just don't really make sense because he limped to start. Pocket jacks don't make that much sense for the same reason. Pocket 9 start to make a little more sense given the line but still questionable to call a $40 raise pre-flop.  AK might due this?  I'm really not sure.  I thought about jamming at this point because I only had about $500 behind. I was behind jacks, 9s, 5s and maybe like a5 suited(?) but ahead of everything else. I kept looping back to having him on aces or kings.

I just started playing nl10 and I noticed something very strange. I open raise from EP or MP and one of the blinds call, first thing they do is bet and when there's a flush draw they bet pot a lot of times and I don't know what to do against it. When I played nl2 and nl5 I've never seen people betting pot right away on flush/straight draw boards. How to play against that? How do I even put anyone on a hand in that situation?

On a typical night I’ll be able to walk out the club with a profit and obviously know what I’m doing quite well. Since covid I’ve been avoiding playing in card clubs and have been playing home games with some amateur friends of mine. I find playing with them so hard because there is no logic involved in their game and it’s impossible to put them on a hand. If I weren’t around there would be absolutely zero pre-flop betting and essentially no matter what I raise it to I’ll still get 5 callers. While this might sound great to play with fish, unless the flop directly connects with my hand I have 5 people who could have any combination of hand and it makes it so hard to make a play. Bluffs almost never get through so unless I have the goods I can’t make any money off these guys.

In addition, there’s no cap on his winnings correct? If I sunrun and win $3k he still gets $150.

There was a bit of drinking involved, so I expected the game to be a little looser than usual.

Anyway, approximate stack sizes for the following hand:

SB:  1100  
BB:  700  
UTG:  750  
MP:  350  
HJ:  600  
CO:  2000  
BTN:  986

Hero is BTN with AhKs and straddles to $8.  SB, BB, UTG, HJ, CO all call ($48).  Hero raises option to $68, and everyone calls ($408).

**Flop:**  Kh 3s 4s  
Checks to Hero who jams for $918.  SB calls, everyone else folds.

**Turn:**  8d

**River:**  5s

SB shows JsTs.

**My thoughts:**  With six players seeing the flop, I wanted to give everyone a poor price to call.  I did the math and figured I was about 2.1:1 against FD or OESD.  I think I played my hand rather transparently and was lucky I did not run into any two-pair or better holdings, and was only unlucky that SB completed his flush on the river -- I mean, he should need about 41% equity to make a profitable call, right?

Maybe I could have raised larger preflop.  I appreciate any thoughts.  Thanks.",1602456015
9598,New to poker with basic questions,poker,"I am new to poker, and am having a hard time finding straightforward answers to some of my (silly) questions. 

1) In a casino, do people announce the amount of a bet/raise, or do you have to do the math looking at the amount of chips they put out? 

2) Is the value associated with a raise always the total amount of the chips that you have put into the pot during that individual betting round. For example, if you're in the BB playing 1/2, and someone raises to 6, if you were to reraise to 20 you would really only be adding 18 to your original BB of 2, but still announcing a raise to 20? Or do you announce a raise of 18 as this is the extra you're adding to your original value of 2 from the blinds? Basically do you say raise then the total amount or the additional amount on top of the call? 

3) Can someone explain the idea of what a min-raise is? If you're playing 1/2, the min-raise that someone could make is 4, right? Because this is double the BB? But then what is the next min-raise that could be made? Is it 8 as this is double the value of the last raise, or 6 as this is the value of the last raise + the min raise amount of 2?

4) What tools can you use to practice doing all this raising/calling math quickly. I watched a little live casino game for the first time last weekend, and was struggling to even comprehend whose turn it was because of how quickly people were moving, much less being able to keep track of the math of how much someone could raise by/how much was needed to call/other stuff like that.

Thanks for the help, any clarification/tips is greatly appreciated!",1602455046

This is my graph for the last 1000 games I played. I play 6max hyper-turbo double or nothing sit and gos, the buy-in is £5 + 50p. For those that don't know how these work, 6 players sit down and when 3 people are knocked out the game ends and the rest of the players double their buy-in, they have a fairly different strategy from regular sngs and play more like satellites, mainly because you don't have to have all the chips to win, you just need to outlast 3 people. With the high 10% rake you need to win 55% of the time just to break even (rakeback not included, the site I play on has a very good rakeback structure up to 40%), I'm currently winning about 56.5%.

I feel like 1000 is enough for a fairly accurate ROI but I know hypers are super swingy so if anyone thinks I need to get more in that let me know.",1602432294

9627,Worst Bad Beat of This Year,poker,"As a headnote, I’ve been a break-even poker player for over ten years now, so I’d say I know my way around the block.

My story starts at my local $1/$2 cardroom, which is still capped at a max of 6 players per table. That was probably the first sign that something was going to go wrong. In my opinion, you can’t play with 6 people. Blinds go around too fast, and it’s hard to make any hand.

That being said, the room was full of fish as always. I sat down for $600 next to two guys with sunglasses and earbuds. Perfect. Wannabe pros. One orbit in and my slow-played aces already bust some bluff happy fish who bet three streets with his jacks on a ten high board. Easy.

Now to the terrible bad beat hand. I’m sitting at ~$1100 under the gun (I had won a bit more off all the fish by now), which means I’m directly left of the big blind button. I look down and see the 5 of hearts and 6 of hearts. I call, hoping to spike a straight or flush on the flop. Everyone folds to the dealer button, who raises it up to $10. The small blind (some Asian wannabe pro)  then three-bets to $40. Now three-bets are very strong, and usually only mean queens, kings, aces, and maybe ace-king. However, he is also a big stack so I figure I can spike the flop and stack him. The big blind folds, I call the $38 more, and the dealer button folds. 

Flop comes: 5 of clubs, 8 of hearts, 6 of spades. 

Perfect. I give him a stare down as he thinks, and he eventually decides to check. I pretend to think it over, and after a long time announce a bet to $75. He raises to $225, and I call. My plan was to trap the fish, since he seemed to be bluffing every other hand the entire night.

Turn comes: 9 of hearts.

Of course now any 7 makes a straight, which makes it a terrible turn. Straights beat any pair or even two pair, so even a single 7 makes my pair of 5s and 6s useless. However, if the next card is a heart I could also make a flush, which is 5 cards of the same suit. A flush is higher than a straight, so I would then beat any potential 7. He checks, and I check back.

River: 5 of spades.

Bingo. Now I have a full house, which is a pair and a three-of-a-kind. A full house beats a straight and even a flush, so I have the trap laid out perfectly. He checks it over to me again, and I bet $400 trying to make it look like a bluff, and the Asian kid tanks. He then raises me all-in, which is my entire stack since he was in for more than me. I snap call, expecting to win. Instead, he shows two black 8s, for a higher full house.

What a fucking joke that was. I get mad even thinking about it, poker always rewards the fish. First of all, three-bets should only be for queens and higher. Raising with eights is a stupid way to lose money, but of course it works out for him. I immediately rebought for $200 and waited for the Asian kid to three-bet again, wanting to punish him. A few orbits later, I jammed my pocket 4s over his three-bet and he called off with Ace-king. Another moron move. Ace-king doesn’t even make a pair, and he calls off almost $200 with it preflop. Of course he hits an ace on the turn and scoops, like the huge fish he is.

Anyways, that’s my story of how I lost $1,300 on my first night back to a huge fish. I gave him a piece of my mind about how you shouldn’t be three-betting with pocket eights preflop, and that ace-king is a drawing hand that should never call an all-in preflop. Of course he doesn’t listen. I’m going back next week and you’re damn sure I’m going to take back all the money that moron fish stole from me.",1602396536

9648,Which is better Ignition or ACR specifically for 10nl cash game traffic/ softness?,poker,"Trying to decide between the 2. I can comfortably play 6 or 7 regular tables of 6max 10nl or 2 tables of fast fold + 1 regular table

 Ignition limits that to 4 total tables which is a little slow, but fine as I probably make more bb/100 when 4 tabling regular tables and my redline is way better, plus no rakeback so i need to focus more on bb/100

I have both Holdem Indicator (great for Ignition) and Drive HUD (and player x ray which works for auto taking notes on players on ACR) and I know roughly how to use it and exploit players based on their stats, I enjoy learning, getting better, and hunting specific players, there is also a sense of comradery when you battle against someone every day

With Ignition everything is anonymous so I wonder if I can actually improve as much or if it will be as much fun. And I think weird shit is more likely to occur specifically in regards to people 4 bet shoving or 3 bet shoving with much wider ranges, when I played 5nl fast fold back on bovada they could show up with anything from pocket 4s to ace queen to aces and u have no way of knowing which player it is, making Queens a tough decision

I have heard in general Ignition has more fish, but what about specifically 10nl traffic?

ACR has 27% rakeback, Ignition basically has none

ACR offers fast fold 10nl while Ignition fast fold 10nl NEVER has players, though im pretty sure the people playing fast fold 10nl on ACR are significantly better on average than those playing on thr regular ACR tables

And ACR has bots even at 5nl when I played last year, but does Ignition have bots and how would u even know? Are bots more effective on sites that allow tracking software/HUDs? Or are they not sophisticated enough to take into account player stats?

Finally Ignition offers me a sign up bonus, while I don't have that option on ACR, I thought maybe play ACR at 10nl build up a roll for 25nl then cash out and deposit $500-$600 on Ignition to bonus chase, whereas right now I'd only be depositing $200 and playing 10nl, harder to clear, less to bonus to clear?

Thoughts? Advice? Its basically impossible for me to know without playimg what the 10nl regular table traffic is on Ignition because they changed it so u cant even see the number of tables/ select, it auto puts u on tables and auto moves u around",1602361051

**What would the top 75% of this range look like? What would the top 50% look like?**

The book isn't clear on this, but it does mention that when expanding a range, you should add suited hands first. Never add unsuited hands.

So, to start paring down this range, would I begin by subtracting all off-suit hands (maybe below AQ+)? Then start subtracting the suited connectors? Then all Broadway-9s hands - then the weaker Suited Aces?

9696,3 fairly standard hands from 1/2 that I probably misplayed,poker,"I've been running badly lately to the point where fairly mundane hands are throwing me off a little. Could just be a slow start back to casino poker but needed a little feedback on some hands please.

Here goes.

Hand 1

Playing 1/2 and sitting fairly deep with about 500 behind, villain covers. No history with villain and only been at table for an hour so not much I can tell this far.

6-handed, Hero straddles UTG and villain makes it 10 from the HJ. Folds to H who calls with J9o.

Pot 23.

Flop comes JT9r.

Hero checks, V bets 30, hero raises to 90, V calls.

Pot 203.

Turn is Ah.

V bets 100, villain raises to 200, hero?


Hand 2

Again no history with villain.

Hero is in BB with AJo and around 300 effective. V in CO opens 12, hero 3bets to 40, villain calls. 

Pot is 81.

Flop is A34r.

Hero bets 35, villain raises 85. Hero? 

In hindsight this seems like a call but the are almost no draws I'd expect V to have and the board really hits my range here. I'm also thinking that if I call the raise then there's about a pot sized bet behind and unless the turn is a J I'm going to have a tough time calling down. Thoughts?


Hand 3

Hero is HJ and LJ (UTG) has put a straddle on.

Hero opens AQo to 15, same villain as hand 1 calls and BB calls.

This is now an hour later and villain from hand one has been making some marginal plays, betting a lot with 2nd or 3rd pair into multiple opponents and getting caught in bluffs.

Pot 51.

Flop comes 773hh. Hero checks. I'd probably bet here half the time but this time decided to check.
V bets 50, BB folds, H calls. Maybe could just C/F here but had Ah so with 2 overs and a backdoor I peel.

Pot is 151.

Turn is Qh. Should I ever lead out here? Hero checks planning to check call, but villain checks back.

River is Kc.

Hero checks again. V bets 100. Hero?",1602278321

9700,Confessions of a covid positive poker player,poker,"Buckle up.. this is gonna be long. 


TLDR : stop being dumb and follow casino protocols in private and semi public poker games because personal responsibility means not harming others.


Poker players are, for the most part, live and let live people. We all know that we're there to take each other's money or gamble and anything else is bad for business and most of us act accordingly with a certain degree of respect. Money is how we keep score and not much else matters. 


Poker is a high risk activity for covid. We all know it.. all of us that play accept the risk and should be able to because personal responsibility is a thing. However, every good libertarian will tell you that personal responsibility only goes as far as the do no harm rule which means that one person's actions cannot harm another person's freedom of action. 


Casinos don't give a damn about people.. but they are excellent at limiting risk and liability. As long as private or semi public games continue to not require full and proper mask usage and sanitization protocol then game runners and players are intentionally putting each other at a much higher degree of risk than is necessary. Casinos have shown us a blue print on how to do this as safely as possible and there is absolutely no reason not to do it. 


I'm just as guilty as anybody. I play over 20 hours a week of live poker in the middle of a pandemic. supplemented with online play, this is how I pay my mortgage and bills. When somebody came into the game and didn't wanna wear a mask I chuckled and shrugged while making note of the person's likely high risk tolerance and possible willingness to put their money in a bad spot and went to work on taking the person's money. Until one of those people was in denial about having covid and proceeded to give it to half the table whether they were masked or not because they rambled and spewed into the air for hours and then you took a drink or your mask was a little loose in the nose and you breath in and you're screwed because you're in the same space for 7 hours. 


It's shitty to not say anything until after you're burned and I own that.. but shittier to never say anything at all. Because at the end of the day that person's personal decision harmed the personal decisions of the rest of us and put our health at risk unnecessarily, a clear violation of the do no harm principle and we enabled and allowed that. We all accept the risk.. but it is wrong for 1 or 2 to force a higher degree of risk on the rest than they want to accept. The tyranny of the minority should not hold sway. Game runners and all players need to be real about what that means instead of fooling themselves about it either out of ignorance, laziness, fear of confrontation, or a twisted self interest. 


If everybody decides to not have any rules then cool do what you want but if you have a mixed group I can personally attest that that simply does not work and you're either lying to yourself or you're lying to your players or both. We had a legit outbreak in our game to prove it. Outbreaks are bad for business. The casinos know this, why don't we? The free market will decide what continues and what doesn't but I'm personally calling on all poker players to demand better and be better for the community and for yourself as well as those you interact with and love or care about. 


Be better by using the power of game selection and demanding better of your game runners and fellow players. I firmly plan on doing so on principle despite my soon to be acquired covid immunity because healthy players are good for business and covid outbreaks are bad for business. I feel it's important to lead by example and not ask something of others that you aren't willing to do yourself. 


Will outbreaks still happen even if correct protocols are followed? More than likely yes.. but poker like life is all about risk management and mitigation and if it gets it to happen less often for little effort it's worth doing.

**The Villains**

***Some names/nationalities/character description have been changed because of privacy*** 

Clicki finished 5th in the tourney for 180k$, he was familiar with winning these amounts and was gutted after being coolered brutally.   
An absolutely amazing score and run for a 888$ dollar buy-in tournament nonetheless.  
In the meantime Gary received his hospital bill, I think it was around 2300$.  
His insurance magically covered all the expenses and his parents never found out.   
He tells me he’s going to take it easy for this summer, as he did take several loans to finance his trip to Vegas.   
He even applied for a loan at the local bank beforehand, you can imagine that did not come through.   
However Gary wouldn’t be Gary if he wasn’t talking about other opportunities that would come in the (near) future. ‘’I think I first should play an EPT main event in order to gain some experience for the WSOP main event. I’m not gonna bother with small tourneys anymore’’.  
I always love it when Gary talks about high buy in tournaments while his tank is at 0, call it ambition.   
   
I figured that by renting out my place I could travel a bit through Europe.

As a result of that I found myself with my friend Rien in Bratislava later that summer.

After a good start on the first day I’m off the next one, I’m sitting down in a cash game and there seems to be a seat reserved.   
At the reserved place there is already 2k euro in chips, this is always a good sign.   
Usually well known local players seem to do this and they aren't the best players, often semi shady types that wanna show the table they have money and the authority to reserve a seat while everyone is already playing. 

Around one hour later the exact type that I expected shows up, it’s the type you’d see walking on the street and you would know; he probably doesn’t work for the government so to say. 

His name didn’t really surprised me either: Boris 

Because of his overly aggressive play I know to win a 500 euro pot of him and he immediately doesn’t like me that much. He’s talking a bit of shit to me in Slovakian but I think it wasn’t too bad. I just won a nice pot of him so I wasn't too bothered with it anyways.

It’s just one of those many characters you come across in poker. 

This brings me back to the story of another classic Villain story out of Dublin.  
I never got his name but he turned out to be some kind of Polish drug dealer. 

After playing a small tournament in Dublin, an acquaintance of mine is playing in a 4 card poker game. I’m having a look at his table and one guy immediately stands out. 

He’s wearing a nice suit, a typical Louis Vuitton handbag across his shoulder, sunglasses of a designer brand, you get the picture.  
He’s leaning back in his chair and on his left is a table full of cocktails, probably around 6 different drinks. He has a massive stack in front of him of around 4000 euro (blinds are 1/2).   
On his right is a woman who’s with him, whenever it’s his turn he just says POT, instructing the dealer next to him to count the pot and that would be exactly what he would bet without even taking a glimpse at his cards.   
After this ritual, that occurred every single hand, the woman next to him would show him his cards. 

Although 4 card poker isn’t really my game, a game with a guy who isn’t even watching his cards before making full pot bets should be beatable.

I decide to sit down and every pot is big because he’s in every pot.   
At one moment I’m observing him and expertly he moves a chip with an unknown substance to his nose, while sitting on the table with nine other people.   
Jesus, this guy must be more crazy than I could imagine, sniffing cocaine (?) in public. 

The dealer, an elderly woman, also noticed what happened and was looking in shock yet did not make a fuss about it. 

One player in particular, got really unlucky in multiple pots against him. 

After a while the player, with either Indian or Turkish roots, starts complaining a bit. 

The Polish cocaine sniffer promptly replies with: ‘Shut up Durum Kebab’ 

I thought this comment was out of order yet incredibly funny and really had to make an effort not to burst out laughing. 

The floor/supervisor was called to check what’s going on and of course he was the first one to describe the situation.  
‘Durum Kebab is complaining about a 2k pot he lost, you know how much I lost last month? 60k!’ 

The attendance of a supervisor didn’t hold him back from telling the other player that he should shut up or he would sleep for a long time. 

I would come across this same exact person roughly 28 hours later.   
It’s around 3:30 am as I’ve been listening to an arguing drunk guy in the room next to me long enough to start complaining about it at the reception. 

Once I arrive at the reception there’s a couple in front of me.   
Probably the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen and the Polish guy.   
He’s wearing a Rolex and I can clearly see a Cross tattooed in his hand palm. 

This was definitely another woman than he was with the night before, I wasn’t surprised about that.  
The first thing I hear him saying is: ‘I want the presidential suite’ 

That’s not available sir.  
‘Not available!? When is it available? I need the best room you have’

Followed by: ‘I wanna top up my credit’ 

My best guess was he was putting on a little bit of a show to impress the beautiful woman who was with him. 

After receiving the best room available he made clear that the employee shouldn’t mention his stay to anyone because he knew what would happen if he talked.   
Basically I heard this guy make two death threads within 28 hours and get away with it.   
I was curious to know the story behind this guy and when I asked Greg, the security I had known for years. His answer was distinctly: He is well known for being deep in ‘the business’.  

Fun fact about Dublin: There are no drinks ordered after 12 (?) on Sundays.   
I was  surprised and pointed out that the hotel that hosted the event missed out on a lot of revenue.   
The owner looked into a room with 60 people, ''You see those people? If we keep serving them, 70% won't show up at work tomorrow. It's government instructions.''",1602268658

Hi guys,

I'm a long-term winning player at low stakes playing a mix of MTTs and PLO (both Zoom and regular tables). I've played for roughly 6 years and shown a profit in every year iirc. I've  never really improved my game much and rely heavily on good intuition and a learning-by-doing approach to the game. As a result of this I've never really talked poker with anyone and haven't gotten to know any poker players throughout the years. Barely even exchanged as much as a single DM. As you can imagine this has made for a rather lonely poker journey thus far, which has certainly hindered my progress and negatively affected my motivation for playing when times are tough at the tables.  


I'm currently studying to be an engineer, but for the next 10 months I'm (almost) free from obligations to my studies, before returning to studying full-time in september 2021. I figured this would be as good a time as any to make this post reaching out to fellow low-stakes PLO/MTT grinders who are also playing full-time (or at least close to it).  


Looking forward to see if anyone around my level (in terms of stakes and profitability) would be interested in making a new acquaintance, that could hopefully turn out to be mutually beneficial both in terms of sharing different approaches to becoming a winning player and perhaps also increasing the level of accountability towards the grind and improvement moving forward.

Best regards",1602234795

Hi Guys.. I have several free hours the next 5 nights at work. Like 8 hours of free time per night.

I knew after WCOOP this year I would have to finally put in some of the tough work improving my game. I am have not been in study mode for several years.

Tonight is night 16/21 and all this free time just got dumped on my lap.

I watch videos all the time, but do not absorb them fully. Right now I am sober, not depressed and my brain is firing pretty decent, so I want to make the best of this time.

I have a subscription to Run It Once (Essential) and Learn Pro Poker. I mostly play NLHE + PLO MTTs. I got really left behind when GTO became a thing. 

There are so many videos and topics it can be overwhelming. Here is my initial thought...

\-Start a new word document with various categories - Maybe copy the LPP topics.

\-Re-watch entire LPP course and make basic notes (maybe at 1.5x).

\-When I find what my major gaps are, search RIO vids for that topic, sorted by popularity and watch more in-depth  videos, continuing notes.

\-Then on days off, play micro stakes (not worried about rake if I am improving), stay sober,  track hands and reach out for help analyzing some of them.

Few questions:

Party poker - it says I cannot be tracked and my stats cannot be tracked. Is this actually true in practice? I dont see how the software can avoid avoid data collection on specfic stats like VPIP/PFR etc. Just display your screen to another monitor, screen capture it and scrape the data. Is this commonplace or impractical etc? Basically, is anyone using huds on PartyPoker in practice despite them being banned? I feel like they arent just because I am opening super wide and rarely getting 3bet but just someone who plays a lot more can confirm?

Do I buy holdem manager or pokertracker? What are most people using?

Leakbuster - ignoring the articles, is this worth it for the filters? Cant you just save custom filters in HEM/PT to find the same leaks? Things I would like to search for example are:

Hero PFR IP HU

\-cbet

\-no cbet

Hero PFR OOP HU

\-cbet

\-no cbet

Hero PFR/non PFR

Hero ColdCalling

Hero limping 

Hero Squeezing

Filter to hands that make it to the river to see redline/blue line and exclude check/check hands.

PIO Solver: I doubt I need this for the stakes I am playing currently online or live, but its an interesting thing I have been watching a lot of training material on. Its about 500 bucks I assume unless there are free alternatives on the market? Who is actually using this? Do people playing zoom 100 for example use this to self improve?

My PC is pretty good. 3700x and 32GB RAM. How fast can it solve the tree if I give it the following bet sizes: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, pot, 1.25, 1.5, 2x pot on every street? Should I be nodelocking to less sizes? I assume yes but a time estimate for the tree would be helpful. 

Do I need more RAM? I think I can go to 128GB relatively easily. 

Do I need more storage? Does it need to be SSD for all of it?

Interesting thing someone who is way better at poker than me told me about PIO. It suggests you defend way more hands than you actually should, because villains are never bluffing balanced. I tend to agree with that statement both online and live. Am I understanding this incorrectly or do people tend to disagree?

How long did it take for you to learn how to use PIO solver effectively?

Also if there are poker study groups with slots open, someone hit me up with a dm or something.

I am organizing an online virtual poker tournament as part of a philanthropy event, and I could use some advise on what platform to use. I need to find one that meets the following criteria:

* Free to play/participate.
* Participants can play just for fun; that is to say, it doesn't just have real money games.
* Is legal to use in the U.S. outside of New Jersey.
* Has private games/rooms; ideally this would be something like I create a room and post a shareable link for participants to join.
* Ideally, is quick and easy to register.

I'm not saying I'm a super shark with the insane reads or anything live, that's probably one of the weakest parts of my play but I don't want to be behind. I'd prefer a site that minimizes the use of external software/trackers if possible due to buggy code or whatever.

 I was playing online yesterday, 3 table sit &amp; go, $10 to play. I was doing pretty well, and on about my third or fourth big blind I’ve got J6o and there are a couple limpers, all of which have position, I check my option. Flop comes 666 and boy I couldn’t be happier. Checks around to the button who bets, I just flat call and all but 1 other person folds. Turn comes a 10, I check, button bets even bigger, leaving him with ~5 big blinds and me with ~7. I’m thinking “oh boy, this poor guy” and flat call again. River comes a 7 and now, to prevent him from checking behind, I go to take him all in. 

I click the bet button and nothing happens. I’m thinking “no no no no no no not now” and I get to watch as my time ticks all the way down, auto checking me. then nothing, no action whatsoever for a solid 30 seconds. Next thing I know, I’m disconnected from the hand and it auto folds me to a very small bet from the button, crippling me for the rest of the tournament. I later got it in with QQ and got called by KK and knocked out. A potential first prize of $100 may not seem like much, but that’s 2 weeks of groceries to a broke college kid, so needless to say, I was less than thrilled. 

So yeah, flopping quads and building up a large pot only to auto fold the river cuz of bad apartment wifi was greattttttt",1602197235

I am trying to choose decent chips to play with some friends, nothing really professional, just some casual games, but we would like high quality.

I have been doing some research and looks like people tend to prefer 10 grams clay chips. They are THE REAL CHIPS, used in casinos and if you play with any other thing you are a completely filthy casual who deserves to lose your money to them.

Now, here is the thing, we, as casual players, put so much value in the esthetics of the chip, we would like them to look good, and have found some that we really like, like the [2009 EPT](https://www.tiendadelpoker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tiendadelpoker-fichas-etp-2009-negras-valor-100-01.jpg) or the [Montecarlo Royale Crown](https://www.pokerchips.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x1000/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/o/monte-carlo-10000-orange-poker-chips.jpg). Problem being, first ones are ceramic, not clay, and the latter having a weight of 14 grams. Or is it actually a problem? I would like to find out if the extreme attitude regarding poker specs is logical or another part of poker elitism, because apparently many casinos use the Paulson clay but imho they are horrible.

We would really appreciate your opinion and comments in this matter or, if you do not want to spend the time in writing a whole post, answering in the pool if you would consider, in your experience, that any of those chips spoken about earlier are a bad purchase (0.8€ per chip the EPT ones and 0.3€ the Montecarlo´s) considering that we plan on start going to casinos once we reach the right blind levels).

As always, thank you really much =)

All of them have consistently competed with the others at the top of their respective sports.

Even Negreanu has a better case, considering he’s still battling in the high rollers and is taking on Doug in this HUNL challenge. 

Tldr: Phil Hellmuth has no argument to be one of the GOATs in poker because he chooses not to compete at the highest level. MJ didn’t leave the Bulls to go play in the G League, he went to another team in the NBA and competed against the best every game.",1602175387

**‘Oh no honey, it’s 44’’**

So I finally got my Vegas experience and although it wasn’t a great success from a money point of view, it was a great first experience.

Like every player I’ve wandered about what Vegas would be like ever since I first played cards, watched 2 months 2 million and saw the famous Chris Moneymaker footage.

We go back roughly six years in time and we found a very young me in New Zealand.   
I was there for a Marketing internship and was already grinding the low stakes online.  
If you ever have the opportunity for sure go to New Zealand, and play in the SkyCity Tower Casino in Auckland. Very nice poker room with a view over the whole city.   
I always sold a bit of action to play live because I definitely wasn’t rolled for those games, being an intern student. 

Anyways, my internship ended and I have my good friend Rick visiting me all the way from Holland.   
We find ourselves sitting in the Irish Pub, drinking Heino’s of 5 euro. 

We’ve had a good amount of them and I notice an elderly woman a few tables winking at me. I’m 22 and tell Rick what I just noticed.   
Being a true friend he immediately encourages me to seal the deal.   
‘A true milf man, you have to go for it’   
I approach her, we have a drink and she tells me she’s 34 years old and from Brazil.  
12 years age difference and from South America, nice. 

We end up in her hotel room and the next day Rick, me and another guy are off the South Island. I can still remember the cab driver laughing when I told him about what happened the night before.   
During our trip in the South Island we visited the casino in Christchurch.  
I’m the first one to sit down and there’s an Asian gentleman next to me in seat 1, he’s in the middle of a big pot when he is handed the hot tea he ordered.   
Being polite he decided to take off the waitress and put it on one of the tables close to him, but not without getting up from his chair.   
It was his turn to act and when he turned around, literally 10 seconds later, he saw that the dealer mucked his hand. This led to an incredible outburst which was very understandable to be honest. His hand must have been very strong.  
Poker is weird, if someone gets screwed it’s always funny except when it’s you.   
It’s like seeing people miss the train after giving it all during a last sprint, it never gets old. 

I didn’t speak to the Brazilian woman but when we were back in Auckland I decided to contact her.   
She’s keen to meet again that night, she’s staying at another hotel. 

Being a young gentleman I invite her to a classy place for some drinks.   
We’re casually talking and I mention I really would love to go to Vegas one day.   
She said ‘Oh it’s great I’ve been there 15 years ago’.    
I ask her how that’s possible because she’s 34 and you have to be 21 to go out and play.   
She looks at me and says ‘Oh honey, no not 34, 44’  
Well this was certainly interesting, the age difference wasn’t 12 but 22 years.   
We had a great night and apparently she focused more on her performance between the sheets than she did on making breakfasts in the past 44 years. Worst breakfast of my life.

Back in the now, I’ve returned home from Vegas and the money part starts worrying me a bit in the back of my mind. It’s not that I didn’t have money,   
I just didn’t want to spend money while being home.   
Money had better purposes, I’d rather spend it towards experiences like the Vegas trip.  
However, the gap year was a calculated decision, so at the end of the day it would be fine.  
The only thing you can do is keep showing up and play your best.

Within 5 days I got a really good run online and won the full 5k back, this is great.   
Vegas has basically been turned into a free trip now.   
In the meantime Gary let’s me know he’s staying close to the mailbox while being home, he doesn’t want his mom or dad to find a hospital bill.   
I picture the scene out of Harry Potter where Harry is waiting for his letter from Hogwarts.  
Things are going a whole lot better for our other Irish friend Clicki, he made the final table of the Crazy 888 WSOP event! One thing is sure, that backer he wanted to keep happy, he must have been very happy.",1602173285
9777,vpip/pfr micro cash games,poker,"What's up guys. I've seen a lot of sites which say that the 'tag' player should have stats like 14/12, roughly of course, I don't remember exact stats. My stats are 11.50/9 and I'm profitable in nl5 and nl2, I'm around 3bb/100 right now. Now here's a question. How in the hell do you get your vpip to 14? I Play suited connectors from 65s up from late positions, I play hands like KTs, QTs, JTs, ATs from mid/late pos. same with pocket pars like 55, 66. In btn I open very wide, almost every ace and still I average about 11.50 vpip. Same with pfr, how in the hell do you get 12 pfr if you have people open raising from ep. and you have a hand like JTs in CO, should I 3 bet or flat call? Or should I 3 bet with hands like these when people open from mp? I'm profitable but something is missing in my game because I know 11.50 vpip is just too tight. What about hands like unsuited connectors from late pos? Like 76o etc. I just don't get it because I play all hands that kind of make sense like: all pocket pairs, suited connectors 65s and up, suited broadways and some unsuited like KQo, QJo.

I 3 bet with AQs, AQo, AKs, AKo, AA, KK, QQ when someone opens in ep(I may flat AQo sometimes in the btn when someone opens from ep). I will 3 bet with KQs, QJs, JJ, TT, 99, 88, AJs if someone opens in mp. I honestly don't know what to do when I'm in sb/bb with 88, 99, TT and someone opens from ep/mp.

Today i moved from PS to PartyPoker, after making my first deposite, i thought i didnt receive my bonus, which later on i found that i did, so i contacted to the support, unfortunatly there was a missunderstood between me and the agent i was talking to so i ended up being very rude toward him saying to him \*Are you a fucking Robot?\* the poor agent replied to me \* Please do not curse as you might get chat restricted \* after that i just closed the chat window and went on finishing what i was doing before.   
As it is late evening where i live, its about time to start re-thinking about my whole day and all what i have been through today, it was then where i remembered myself being rude toward that Agent and i felt very bad about it so i thought i will log in again and contact the support hoping that i will find him, hence i found an other agent, i explained to him that i earlier today i was rude to one of his colleagues and that i wanted to appologise to him and asked if he knew him, he confirmed to me that he knew so i asked him to send him my appology and that im very sorry for how i treated, first he wanted to transfer me but later he came back and said that he was busy handling with other customers, but he did indeed send him my appology and that he was very happy that i did that and he added jokingly \* You should confirm your account \*.   
Later on i kept chatting with the 2nd agent on how customers can be rude and how i fully know what he is talking about as i used to work as a customer service agent for another huge company, later he said that he thinks that human decency shall be rewarded and gave me 10 usd of tournement money, i couldnt believe it as i didnt expect at all.   
Here is a short screen of my conversation with the 2nd agent, and yes i asked for permission before posting it on Reddit .   
PS1 :  the 2nd agent mentioned to me that they are always facing rude customer but this was literally the first time someone ever appologized for being rude toward them.  
PS2 : im not an english native speaker therefore to you nazi grammars excuse the tons of grammar and vocabulary  mistakes.

**Viva Las Vegas**

I wake up the next day around 1 in the afternoon and am wondering if Gary has shown up for his so-called opportunity of a lifetime. 

By this time Rien and Gertjan, two close Dutch friends, had arrived in Vegas.  
While having pancakes together I receive a text from Gary.

He tells me that he doesn’t feel too well, yet the poker tournament is going the right directions and he doubled his stack. 

I tell him it’s just a bad hangover; hang in there and drink enough water you’ll be fine. 

At this time I’m texting Clicki to see how bad his hangover is, he tells me it’s pretty rough, he hasn’t slept at all yet he’s playing a 1000$ tournament.  
I can’t believe my ears and realize that he just jumped into a tournament that could easily go on for 12 hours without a single minute of sleep and probably still being fairly intoxicated.   
A quick text back from Clicki: ‘Keep the backer happy’   
I doubt if the backer would be happy when he would know in which state he’s currently playing, but Clicki wouldn’t be Clicki if he didn't end up cashing the tourney nonetheless.  
At that time I didn’t know Clicki and me would have our fair share of adventures in Thailand, Taiwan and Cambodia 6 months later. 

Apparently Gary kept feeling very bad, to make things worse he took an unknown substance offered by a total stranger that was at his table.

This resulted in him telling me he thought he was going to have a heart attack, should he call an ambulance he was asking me?   
I told him that he would be better off taking a cab to the hospital if he insisted on going, especially the way the American healthcare is set up. 

Around half an hour later I receive a ‘selfie’ of Gary, on a stretcher, in an ambulance.   
He’s heading straight to the hospital, his stack worth around 1000$ still being in play were least of his concerns. 

Later that night I’m picking up Gary from the hospital with Rien and Gertjan, he turned out to have an anxiety attack.   
We’re in the cab to drop Gary off at the Palms hotel and it’s dead silent.  
Suddenly Gary says; Lad’s, lads I’m still in the tournament. I advanced! YES!   
The fact that the estimated value of his stack dropped from approximately 1000$ to around 290$ didn’t seem to bother him too much. 

None of us cashed the tournament eventually and Vegas turned out to be a cool, yet expensive experience.   
The total trip had cost me around 5000 dollars, definitely not the dream start just after quitting your job. 

Gary, who had planned a three week trip, eventually got his mom book a ticket home after eight days.   
His time in Vegas must have been turbulent including the hospital, getting robbed by a hooker and losing all his money.",1602093229

9836,"Kyle ""ActionPlug"" Sparks Embezzled $170,000",poker,"Always mixed feelings posting this info about online poker operators. It’s discouraging that people do this stuff and depressing to post. But it’s also for the good of others so they don’t become victims of the same thieves. 

In this case I’m talking about Kyle Sparks, a now banned former union head. I’ve posted a bunch of screenshots but here is a summary. 

First point is that Kyle only stole 56k from me. He stole another \~120k from the club owners in the union, but I’ll keep this specific to my personal funds. 

Kyle was solely responsible for accounting and funds management for the union. He fiercely protected what he was doing from others. I could never get an answer about his calculations or if he said my numbers were incorrect. What I did get, is a lot of silent treatment and blow offs about the money I was owed, which was growing with each week.

I didn’t get paid in full from my very first week in this union. And they never caught up. 

It was widely speculated Kyle was embezzling but nobody could quite pin him down. Now with a lot of bills due, Kyle says he doesn’t have the money. 

Luckily The Arbitrator and the remaining union head are working with me to get paid. But this union has to bear the brunt of paying the funds that Kyle stole. He used the typical stall techniques like accusing us of cheating. Several times. Security investigated and found no cheating. Every time. Kyle lied to one of the clubs who was to settle with us, telling the club the union already paid me and that club should pay the union. Kyle purposely hid the settlements with one of the clubs from the rest of the union. He was settling directly and pocketing their payments. 

In closing, this is a bad guy. He’s already started making threats and spreading bullshit. What he hasn’t done though is explain or show anything that indicates where the money has gone. 

As I said, he is now banned from the app. Do business with him at your own risk.

Here he is....

9837,Which HUD stats do you recommend for cash games and how can I learn to interpret them better?,poker,"Currently I am using DriveHUD and I have the following stats in a grid... 

First row of 6 stats is hands/ player profile icon (nit/tight reg/ standard reg/ tricky LAG/ bad lag/ nutball/ fish/ whale)/ VPIP/ PFR/ 3 bet%/ Aggression Factor

I have positional stats on pop over vpip for vpip/ cold call by position but honestly almost never look at it because i play 6-8 tables and dont have 

Second row of 6 stats is... steal/ fold to steal, fold to 3 bet, 4 bet % (should i change this to 4 bet ratio?), fold to 4 bet%, total aggression % with positional popups (this stat i really do not understand how to interpret compared to AF)

I have squeeze and fold to squeeze as popups when i hover over steal, but again rarely have time to look at it so maybe i should replace the 4bet stat with squeeze stat on the main grid? i really have no more room 

third row of 6 stats... fold to c bet, fold to double barrel (should i switch this to just fold to turn c bet?), fold to river c bet, won when saw flop, went to showdown, won $ show down

4th row of 6 stats is villain flop c bet/ turn c bet/ river c bet, check river % after bet bet line, bet/ fold flop after being preflop raiser (im not actually sure what this stat refers to in Drive HUD i was trying to find a stat that told me how often a villain preflop raiser would c bet then fold to a flop 3 bet is this it?), and bet when checked to %

Then i also have bumper icons for ""1 and done, barreling, sticky fish, yummy fish, preflop reg but plays poorly post flop, way too early""

What stats do you guys use? And how would u suggest i alter my HUD to make it more useful? i only have room for 4 rows of 6 stats and like i said i generally dont have much time to hover over for popups

Also does anyone have any suggestions on tools/ articles/ videos training sites that will teach me to interpret these stats better in order to better understand what type of player im dealing with AND how to adjust vs them?

Right now i'm just playing around with equilab to better interpret which hands someone would be playing or not playing based on vpip/pfr/ 3 bet %, but i definitely need help

I'm playing 2nl/5nl on ACR as a bankroll challenge im at 16bb/100 over 53,000 hands and 13.4 EVbb/100, but im actually on a huge 10 buy in downswing (for me ) this week and i actually think part of it is me misinterpreting the HUD stats/ being affected by the HUD telling me someone is a fish/ nit so i dont make moves i normally would.

When i wasnt paying attention to the HUD because of low sample size (or noticed who the multitable/ regs were at 5nl) i was winning 25EVbb/100 over 40,000 hands, probably its variance and me going from 4 to 8 tables but also i feel like im either not interpreting the HUD stats correctly/ adjusting correctly or i'm focusing too much on it.

I guess another factor is the regs had no data on me either when i started 2 months ago.

9849,ACR Conspiracy,poker,"Long story short, I’ve been a borderline tourney reg on ACR since Covid started and have shown some textbook degen tendencies when things go south. With that being said, I am beginning to believe that my cards are being manipulated because I am a consistent depositor during downswings. 

I used to dabble with ACR’s rigged blackjack client and quit when it became obvious how unfair it was. I was to the point where I knew exactly what the dealer’s undercard was. It is designed to trigger the emotions of a degenerate to get pissed and bet larger amounts. I am starting to see the same tendencies in their MTT’s and S&amp;G’s. You can see the unrealistic run outs coming from a mile away, especially if all in pre flop. 

The last couple of days I have played probably 25 tournaments. Every tournament ends in the most unlucky, triggering way possible. Due to my style of play, I’m never in the position of being at risk on the bubble. I either have a good stack or I’m long gone. I’ve bubbled 4 today alone, all of them being out of nowhere and devastating (20-30BB’s). Here is a brief stat sheet of the “Variance” I’ve seen this week:

Yesterday I was knocked out of 3 mtt’s in a row by weaker pairs making a 4 card flush, for some reason spades every time.

Today I was knocked out of 3 mtt’s in a row by a rivered set, all in the span of 25 minutes.

Two runner runner straights benefitting villains dominated ace.

On two separate occasions my opponents post flop bluff with absolute air runner runnered a flush. 

Last night my session ended via boat over boat

Today my session ended with Aces getting ran down by a J4c bully bluff via a 4 on turn and river after i called the all in. This one hurt. 

Any possible way someone can get screwed, I’ve lived it this week. 

I miss my old normal ways of getting beat, tired of this Hollywood BS. I never thought I’d miss running Kings into Aces but here I am. 

Thank you for letting me vent :) 

P.S. I forgot to mention the weirdest part, I flopped quads three times today. Twice with 9’s. I think I’ve flopped quads 2 or 3 times in my entire live playing career. This was my first indicator that things seemed a tad off.

P.S. At one point I was dealt a variation of Ace-deuce 8 out of 20 hands at the same table during the early stages of a tourney.",1602057347

 Anyways back to Vegas, Gary lets me know he just arrived in town and we should go for a drink. He’s with a friend of his, Patrick a.k.a. Clicki. 

I knew Clicki, I once transferred him 1000$ online, a short term loan. I’d only see the guy once and never spoke to him, yet was giving him a 1k loan. Gary said he was good for it.  That’s the poker world.

Gary and Clicki seem to have a hell lot of fun at the craps table in a video they send me.   
I advanced in the tournament and am off the next day, so decide to pay them a visit in the Flamingo casino. 

There was one other guy, his name was Matt. Despite being white he talked like some American rapper and he kept telling me that he could have me sign an NBA contract first thing in the morning because of my height. 

One thing was immediately clear, this group was here to party. 

We are getting strong mixers for 10$ a drink, this would go a bit against my normal standards but it was Vegas after all. 

Gary, not surprisingly already in fairly drunk shape after arriving 2 hours in Vegas, tells me there was this woman who wanted to sleep with him.

I told him he should totally go for it and after not seeing him for one hour he came back.   
I will never forget him telling me he just fucked a whale, she was so fat he thought he was riding her legs. 

Matt, Clicki and I were all dying of laughter, especially after seeing his face when he realized he didn’t use a condom. 

Another two hours later, it must be around 3am, we find ourselves at the hotel room of Clicki, there’s plenty enough booze (and illegal substances) around. Gary, who is staying there as well, tells us we should leave the room. He has a tournament the next morning at 11 and according to him this was the opportunity of a lifetime for him.   
You could ask yourself how serious you could take a man, who just drank all night (and fucked a whale), talking about the opportunity of a lifetime the next morning.

Because we were on zoom BU described his thought process something along the lines of: ""I thought you didn't have a pocket pair, so if you called it would be a coin flip"". My immediate reaction to the hand was that it was played badly by BU. I don't see any reason to eliminate pocket pairs from BB's range, so BB's calling range should be significantly better than sixes, not a coin flip. I also don't think that BU gets much more fold equity by shoving than he'd get with a smaller bet of $8 or $10, and then he'd get to save some money if BB continues because he'd know he'd likely be behind their range (depending on the flop). I did some analysis with flopzilla and the play seemed much more reasonable than I originally thought:

This whole fiasco is a demonstration of how people substitute their opinions, and the opinions of others, for fact.

Player does have 14 hours playing a 5/10/25 PLO game with a winrate of $289/hr, but that game rarely runs and the hours put in are insignificant.

I'm like ""what do you mean by that?"" 

""Well you aren't a good tipper.""

""Ok well you're about to get no tips from me if the casino opens up""

This is the appropriate response right? Like fuckoff for putting me on blast in front of everyone. I tip $1 for pot 50-100, $2-3 for pots 100-200, and pots over 200 I usually tip $4-5.

He later walked it back with ""well you're not bad, your like the mean""

It's just frustrating because I liked this dealer and then you learn they don't even appreciate your tips. Like tips are optional right? At any point I can just be like ""nah"". Sometimes I think people forget that.",1601998032

9898,Zoom vs reg tables,poker,"Sup guys wanna let you know my experience wanna know what about you how you feel yourself if you play both
Ima new player, stated 3,4 moths ago playing normal 6 max cash game tables, never played poker before

As a person , when i start something new I want to know everything about what i am doing so i start studying while playing, have build bankroll  and domt remember how i have found zoom tables
 
I found myself in trouble cuz of regulars beating these stakes, but i didnt realize, i didnt switch back to normal tables cuz i wanted to play faster hands

Finally i found leaks in my gameplay, i have downloaded a hud, and start studying more. I understood that there are several good guys that know what they are doing and since there was a low pool (italy pstars i gov limited), i understood that need to change my gameplay

Adjusting to ""good"" people at zoom have changed the way I was playing and when i sometimes try to play normal tables OH MAN!

I found it not funny at all! 4,5 way flop, 4,5 fish guys at the same table, just surounded by calling station, short stacks on the left and on the right, The time you get KK+ they will call raise with any ace high, 3 4 way on the flop

Sure its easy to punish and extract money cuz of their postflop mistakes, but will find in trouble cuz of not logical call, not logical hands, not logical mini reraises, not logical anything

So i will put it like this (micros)

Zoom: I like it cuz more creativity, more bluff situation, more people qho understamd positiln, amd its better way to practice hand reading

Normal Cash game tables: Annoying , playing with not understanding guys more tham 1 on the same table i feel idiot muyself and falling asleep

I’m not sure if I did it because it just was that way or because I thought it would make a good story, but within 36 hours after the goodbye office job dinner I found myself sitting on a plane to Vegas.

A nice 10 day journey, which I had booked at the start of the year.  
I can still remember telling my (ex) girlfriend I booked Vegas.  
I expected her to be happy for me, but that was probably naïve.   
Women, especially (ex) girlfriends, are not happy when impulsive young men leave for Vegas.

Once in the plane I felt this feeling of excitement, this was exactly what I should do; live life the fullest. 

Once I arrived I would take a cab, the driver kept asking me if he should pull over somewhere to buy some booze or cannabis.   
Cannabis was recently legalized, but coming from Holland I was not too impressed with that.   
I wouldn’t be the type to go on a mad one by myself the first night and friendly instructed him to drive me to the hotel.   
It was around midnight by the time I could check in and there was my first surprise.   
350$ added resort fees per room.   
Well that’s a nice welcome to Vegas I thought by myself.   
However the room was nice and I was buzzing to be in this city.  
Two days later I was joined by two good friends who I’d always go on poker trips with. 

We mostly had been to Dublin, but Vegas was new for everyone. 

On the second day I’m playing day 1 of a 500$ event, it was literally the softest event I’ve ever played. Some people barely knew how to hold their cards, yet paid 500 dollars to play.  
Poker is a crazy world.

After advancing to day 2 with an under average stack I got a text from Gary.  
Now Gary is the biggest character you will ever meet.  
Brings me back to the story of how I met him. 

I’m in Dublin and it’s my first big poker event, there’s this kid who literally looks like a 15 year old. I figure he must be good at poker to put up this kind of money at his age.   
We happen to be at the same table within 30 minutes he makes a crazy kamikaze bluff, it was literally a suicidal play. 

24 hours later I walked into him in Regency hotel in Dublin where the tournament back then was held, he’s all sweating and looking exhausted.   
I ask him: ‘How are you doing man? Did you advance yesterday in the tournament?’

‘Awh no bro, I busted out the tournament (I was not surprised). I have been playing here ever since, I haven’t slept yet. I’m down 2 grand for fuck sake.

My crazy idea was it now, to let my girlfriend play, she might suck it up totally, but it doesn't mind, if she sucks up, or I can't play at all, but right when I had this idea, of course I was thinking, it might not be allowed. So can you please share me your experiences, and maybe even a direct link in the ToS of 888? Would be great

Folds to V in the cutoff who opens to 15 (typical size for him), hero defends the BB with Th7h.

(30) Flop is Td8c2s, hero check calls a bet of 20.  Never folding top pair otf against V's like this.

(65). Turn is 9c, hero check calls a bet of 40.  Hard to fold top pair and a gutshot to a 6.

(145).  River is the 7d, which gives us two pair.  Betting out here seems bad, so I put in the check.  V quickly tosses out a single black chip (100).

Hero?

9983,Advice for a 19 Year old UK poker player,poker,"Hi everyone, I’m 19 years old from the Uk and I started playing poker about 7 months ago. I played online poker for fun and a pass time but got bored of it as when I tried to play properly no one else does and it’s boring just being sat behind a screen anyway! I watched DN masterclass and I’m reading The Theory Of Poker at the moment. However, I’ve been to the casino 5 times now and lost £900 in total over 2 1/2 months. I only earn about £1400 a month and whilst trying to save for a house etc I keep a bit of my money for poker. 

My problems are this, I don’t have enough money to have a bank roll. I can do £300 a month max so 2 sessions at the casino if I don’t rebuy in that session. 
After ever session I feel empty, I know exactly what I’ve done wrong. Mainly putting myself in bad situations or bluffing in unthought out bad spots. Every time I tell myself not to do this yet after every session I find myself in the same place. I don’t live in London so I’ve only got 1 local casino which is pretty much only Regs so I’m finding it hard to play against them. 

I really love to play poker but at 19, without a large bankroll and limited options of where to play and who against I’m feeling stuck on how to progress. Is it really a case of study more, build a bank roll and get a better mindset whilst playing. If you’ve read all this then thanks and I appreciate your feed back.",1601836596
9984,Most engaging form of poker for 5-10 minute bursts,poker,"I work on a free poker site in my spare time, and a lot of my users like playing on their phone for short bursts.  Right now I offer cash games (drop in) filled with bots to ensure you can play right away, single table SNGs (again supplemented by bots) and a nightly MTT.

None of these formats work great for a drop in 5 to 10 minute phone session.  Cash games “work”, but they’re boring and you’re paying a blind when you sit in, and probably timing out when you leave minutes later disrupting the game.  9 man SNGs last about 1.25 hours with their reasonable blind structure.  MTT obviously is out.

There are short stack hyper tourneys, but I’m sure there is something better.  Zoom seems reasonable, but at the end of the day you’re still folding a bunch of hands.  Something progressive perhaps?  6 handed, everyone buys in, lose 5 hands in any way (or run out of chips) and you’re out? What about jumping into randomly constructed situations halfway through, like getting every hand with a small pot and the flop is already shown?  Maybe heads up tournaments are faster, and you can get some kind of bonus for streaking?  Perhaps playing a set of 6-7 hands from 2 decks shuffled together until the cards are gone would give the feel of a larger structure to essentially a cash game.",1601834013

Was there any change you made to your game or game type/selection that changed your opinion or allowed you to better weather the storm of variance? 

I've been around poker for a while now. My brother and I were playing full time before Black Friday and he was very successful at the time. He was a leader at medium stakes husng on sharkscope and did really well in pretty much any game or format he played. I on the hand was the student of the game who bought all of the books and played very seriously but never gained momentum in building a roll or moving up in stakes. I know that a lot of this was because of psychological weakness in handling tilt and risk, but I also feel like I ran worse than some other people. Just the other day my brother said ""I've seen how you run"". 

I know that the typical forum response to these bitching posts is generally a demeaning or insensitive comment about it being standard and that the op is a weak losing player.  I get that sentiment, and I am very critical of my play and aware of my outlook on the game.

When I started playing again I thought Super System was still good enough. However, after a few hard hits in the beginning I've learned a lot. 

I am close to a calling station, hence I do not like to fold, and probably think I am better than what I really am. I think many pros spot my lack of experience within the first 30 minutes so I get pushed around a lot.

* Can I purchase the course/training for a month and download the information without continuing the course payments afterwards?

I just had a hand when a guy was calling my down to the river with J3s and he hit a two pair, I had AK, guys hitting a full house with 72, guys chasing flushes and they get there.

10040,Advice on choosing stakes,poker,"I was a mostly losing player at live tournament poker at my local casino. I've spent a lot of quarantine doing some reading and studying. I made a $20 deposit online about 2 months ago and started playing 4 micro stakes tournaments every night. I was happy to get second place in a tournament which took my bankroll to around $120. I continued playing the same micro stakes tournaments and after 2 more weeks I noticed I was running deeper consistently making it into the money and 2 weeks after that I was more often running very deep in at least one of my nightly tournaments. My bankroll was then around $550. On just the weekends I started to pick one low stakes tournament a day to play and initially didnt have much luck but did have a few small cashes here and there. Recently I saw a midstakes tourney that I thought had good value and after 14 hours I was happy to have won it. My bankroll was now at $3200. The next week, still playing my micros I had a nice $335 score. So far this weekend in a ""treat myself"" mid stakes  tournament I had a nice $264 profit after subtracting buy in. (Also want to add Im not making these deep runs through sucking out or anything, of course there are always flips necessary to be won in MTTs). So with my bankroll around $3800 after only a few months of play, should I leave micros behind and move to low or what? I only have these couple months to base everything on and I dont want to be overconfident and make the wrong move.",1601748544

So i've noticed ALOT lately that I just casually build my stack throughout the early stages of these insanely long tourneys and I get to the mid tourney lvl (in the money with maybe 130 or so ppl left)

Its always at a really pivotal spot for me, like i'm sitting around 30bb or so and a double up would get me in the top 15ish. 

Today it was with around 130 ppl left, 30ish bb deep, I raised KK utg. LJ shoves for about 25bb or so. (???) whatever I call it off. He flips K8 (????????????) soo i'm looking pretty good, this is my big hand. If I win im in the top 10 and ppl are falling quick so it should bump me up a few pay jumps. SO yeah, board comes up X57. Turn, 6. like oh boy dont do this to me. River of course is a 9. WHY lol.

I also noticed this almost always happens when the tourneys have an overlay, and it was a pretty decent one tonight. Previously they would just freeze the torneys and give everyone their buyins back but they haven't done that in awhile. So idk, maybe its my new ACR conspiracy theory. They get some bots in there with their whole Mike Postle getup and claim some of that money back for themselves.

10082,50NL Hand Review- Folding a boat OTR,poker,"Hand played at 50nlz on ACR. H is 123bb and V is 125bb.

H is dealt 77 on the button and defends a 2.6bb open from LJ.

Flop (6.7bb) comes T97, V bets 4bb. H raises to 11.34bb. V calls

Turn (29.38bb) - another T. No flush draws on the board. V checks, H bets 19.02bb. V calls.

River (67.42bb) - J. V checks, H bets 33.7bb leaving behind 56.98bb. V jams and H folds.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure this subreddit will hate this fold, ""you're at the top of your range, he could be bluffing, you're getting X:1 etc. etc."". But at 50nl, is this ever a bluff? I mean realistically I have to hope he's overvaluing AT or QK, but I have him labeled as a reg and realistically with how much I left behind his shoves shouldn't have much fold equity.

[https://viewbook.at/TheMasterMind](https://viewbook.at/TheMasterMind)

https://preview.redd.it/3u24tvpozpq51.jpg?width=246&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7e3ea71c648fc3cf8ab55deb1ac25de1678d260

Enlightenment!—You may spend your whole life seeking it, but never find it. You may never search for it or even know that it’s possible, but reach it by accident. And you may live out your life ignorant of its existence, and die having never discovered your highest potential for happiness, self-mastery, and creative brilliance.

The enlightened psychologist Abraham Maslow was the first to scientifically describe the fully enlightened person—which he called the “self-actualizing person.” Building on Maslow’s work through careful biographical study of the lives of self-actualizing people, humanistic psychologist and biographer Roman Gelperin found their enlightenment to stem from a nearly-identical handful of breakthrough experiences, which he will reveal to you in this book.

Partly a firsthand account of the author’s own accidental enlightenment, and partly a full biography of Abraham Maslow’s rise to self-actualization, this book will teach you how to identify, understand, and attain those key experiences of:

* Unlocking the perennial method of using your mind to its fullest potential
* Being fully at peace with yourself, by deconstructing your internal conflicts
* Deriving a near-constant joy, pleasure, and satisfaction from sheer existence
* Half-creating, half-discovering your driving passion and unique purpose in life
* Automatically evolving the self-actualizing qualities of total honesty, supreme self-confidence, natural creativity, effortless spontaneity, and independent thinking

By the end of this book, you will thoroughly understand what enlightenment is, how and why it occurs, and the ways to pursue it!",1601661267

10142,Poker Dealers being terminated.,poker,"Every poker dealer in Elizabeth, IN, including myself, is being terminated as of 10/1.  This leaves me with several questions.  I've listed my top 5 below.  Feel free to answer and ask you own.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Please let me know if you are aware of any other property that is doing this to their poker dealers.  i.e. Terminating furloughed dealers as of 10/01.
2. Caesars/Eldorado must have an agreement signed by 12/31 to sell the Elizabeth property, as well as Evansville and Hammond.  There are rumors that Churchill Downs, who has created a faux casino on Poplar Level in Louisville with their Historical Racing machines along with a still under construction 300 million dollar hotel/casino on the Downs property, is interested in purchasing the Elizabeth property. There was also a rumor that MGM is interested in all 3.  This would make sense as it would be a good opportunity for them to get into the Indiana/Illinois market, especially since they already have their Indiana sports betting license.  Ads are all over about free bets for joining MGM's app.  Long story short, I plan on moving if there is no commitment to poker from the new owner of the Elizabeth property.  I seriously doubt Churchill Downs would commit, however, do you think MGM would commit to having poker if they purchased the property?
3. Caesars announced yesterday that they were purchasing William Hill Sports Book.  My poker room manager took a job there months ago, as he was already running the sports book at Elizabeth and I assume been offered the job back when this deal was in motion.  To what degree does this represent a shift towards sports betting and away from poker for Caesars in Indiana but also in the US as a whole?
4. Covid has essentially grinded live poker to a halt in much of the country, except for a few rooms here and there in just a handful of states.  The airline industry is terminating or furloughing tens of thousands of employees as of 10/1, the same date we are being terminated.  As far I as know, none of the 60+ poker dealers/floors/duals in Elizabeth were receiving health benefits since August 1.  I am not aware of any cost to the company to keep us furloughed, as opposed to terminating everyone.   Is this some sort of valuation tactic for quarter 4 or the end of the year with the IRS?  Does X amount of employees equal Y amount of deduction?
5. This year has been rough for poker dealers and players everywhere.  Please let me know your thoughts on the overall future of live poker.  What does it look like?",1601592286

10200,What do you consider running bad.,poker,"If you go by EV line in a HUD you will only run below EV if you get it all in ahead and lose. Though will also feel like you ran bad if you have KK, you get in a 4 bet pot, c bet a flop like 652, your opponent shoves on you, yand shows up with 74s, but this will show up as a -EV play as you called when your opponent was ahead. Or if we had KK 3 times in a row and each time an A came on a flop and we had to fold or lost some value to an Ace. 

I think these are instances of running bad but we can get carried away with this because tilt will make us play bad when things like this happen and call when we are beat. But that wouldn't be running bad anymore. More like running bad plus tilting. 

What is an objective way to know how much we are running bad and how much we are playing bad?",1601492233

However, every time I hit even the smallest downswing, I delete my live poker tracking app and create a new database on poker tracker. I just hate seeing losses. It stresses me out, I become results-oriented, and it makes me depressed to look at it like I'm another losing player even though I'm not.

Also, if your win rate is 5bb/100 or 10bb/hour, that's probably not true for that day if you're playing against really tough players. It's misleading because then you think, ""I'm this good of a player"" but maybe you're only good against whales and suck against the regulars. So that's also where tracking your results becomes pointless.

So normally I can recognize this and counter with appropriate strategy. But like I said, I’m entitled to Win because I’m better. Meh.. so I’m down on myself for letting the hole get so deep. It’s literally gonna take two weeks of running good and playing well to even get it all back. I’m accepting the fact that the money is gone but I cannot accept the way I lost it.

If anyone is feeling extra awesome I would love some specific strategy advice. I trust no one more than reddit 💯💯.

RANT WARNING ⚠️ 
Playing against beginner to intermediate players,  no dummies though. I try to play tight but also aggressive on the hands I do play. I’ve been up and down but I can’t figure out a working strategy. I think this is because my friends aren’t playing the same kind of hands consistently enough to identify any information. I feel like they’re harder to play because of their unpredictability. I just feel like their ranges are so so wide that I can’t narrow it down any.

In addition to that I don’t feel like many of them take position into consideration, especially preflop. The hands frequently go multi-way to the flop, as most play marginal hands regardless of position. I think to counteract that I need to bet more preflop. Thoughts?

After the flop I don’t feel that anyone considers the position of the player who bets and how that might affect the betting players range. For example if I raise out of position (narrow range) no one would consider me any stronger than if I were on the button, it checked to me and I bet to induce folds(wider range). This goes for any position implication at the table. The only positional advantage I can utilize is the button because it’s me adjusting my range on other players not the other way around. This makes bluffing a little more difficult because the hand will come down bet sizing and then big stack usually pushes me off the hand. As a result I only really semi bluff and if my semi bluff raise gets called it seem like 9/10 times I get beat by a marginally better hand. Any advice for making a bluff seem more believable/stronger to induce folds?

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/cidenj/another_day_at_the_office_for_omc_pt_2/)

Bev and I are waiting at the door for when the Commerce finally re-opens for business at 10am. The wretched woman hasn't touched the slots since January and I'm lucky to have survived lockdown, and that ain't because of no goddamned China Virus. Instead of Mike, some Latino-yahoo greets us at the door.

""Good morning. I'll need both of you to put your masks on please. Ma'am? Ma'am!"" Bev had primed her scooter before the door had even opened and was gunning it towards the slots, leaving me to deal with this greaser. ""Here in this country, the only piece of cloth I need to protect me is right here"" I say, as I point a thumb to the ""Trump 2020"" flag on the back of my freedom-mobile. He looks back towards his manager, who rushes over.

""Good to see you Merv, how's the hip holding up?"" He pushes Jose' aside and ushers me to the cash machine. I put my card in for the first time in months and almost have an angina flare-up when I see how much my pension has built up to. I start to sweat, and quickly withdraw 4x my usual amount before the she-devil sees.

I roll over to the floor to find the cafe closed. A red haze obscures my vision and I get that familiar headache, and I head to the food counter to give whoever I find a day they won't soon forget. My plans change when I find a sweet blonde honey at the register, who gives me a smile like the one Beverly used to back in the 80s. 

""How you doin' there sweetness? I need a cup o' Joe. What you got cookin' there?"" I give her a wink; this old boy still has the moves. She frowns behind her mask, maybe she's never met a hot-blooded American man like me before. ""Soup sir? Today we have Lamb &amp; Barley"". I give her the nod quicker than you can say Charlton Heston, and get enough tipping dollars from my satchel to put a smile on that dial. When she reaches for the money I grasp her wrist. ""If I was a bit younger I'd take you out for a steak dinner, sunshine""  as I place $5 in her palm and get a good eyeful of the goods. ""I'll bring it out sir"" she says. She sanitizes her hands and quickly runs to the kitchen. Nice to see someone doing their goddamn job around here.

I head to 1/2 and nearly spit out my damn dentures. ""What's this happy horseshit?"" I say to no-one and everyone. Set up around every table are plastic screens, with only enough room to play 5 handed. I roll over to a spot and buy in for $100, and since its a special occasion I decide to post in from the cutoff.

First hand in and Tom deals me A-10s. I breathe a deep sigh of relief as the world is lifted from my shoulders. The pain subsides from my aching bones for just a moment. It folds to me, and I flick the cards into the muck with a contented sigh. ""It's good to be back"".

My soup and coffee arrives and I settle in for the long haul. I'm about to tuck in and I hear some yahoo at the table getting salty. ""Why doesnt he have to wear a mask?"" I turn my hearing aid off and enjoy the sweet bliss. 

9 orbits later and I'm nearly halfway through my soup, and I look down to see almost half my stack has disappeared and I almost cough out a kidney. My tranquility turns to an inferno and I stand up, hip be damned.

""WHICH ONE OF YOU ASSWIPES SWIPED FROM MY STACK!"" Chunks of Barley get coughed onto the screen. I let my rage flow and ignore the floor manager trying to sit me back down, and I give them all a good lesson on manners. I tell them about the Second Amendment, George Dubya, and my 4 figure tournament win in '87, in no particular order. When I'm satisfied I sit back down and turn my hearing aid back on. ""As I was saying, you've been blinded out sir"" the dealer says. ""I haven't even played a hand god damn it!"" The young punk with a hood on to my right laughs; that son of a bitch has a massive stack so must have taken them somehow. 

I get dealt fishhooks on the button, and decide maybe I will loosen up a bit. The dipshit in the hood raises to $8 and I flat him, knowing that if I spike that beautiful set I'll get the maximum. ""How much you got behind there old man? Not much?"" I ignore his sass and pray for my miracle card. 

Yahtzee! I spike my set on a dangerous board of A-J-3 rainbow. The dipshit pulls his jumper up over his neck and checks, possibly checking with his better set. I think about it and decide it's time for a little Hollywood baby, and go into the tank. I scratch my head and crease my brow like Johnny Chan did in the Main in '88. 

""Time"" says the dipshit. They start the countdown and I think even harder. ""What are you running there?"" I ask him. He laughs and moves his hands away from his stack but my eyesight and like the old days and I can't make it out anyways. I check it back.

The turn is another A and I feel sick to my stomach. My own damn fault for getting tricky with my JJ and now this asshole has likely turned a better boat. Dipshit checks it back and there's no way I'm leading into such a strong hand so I check it back for pot control. As they say, that's just poker and sometimes you just get unlucky.

River is another Jack! The poker gods are looking after old Merv once again, and dipshit checks. ""All you can eat baby"" I say as I shove my $53 into a pot of $19, and dipshit throws it away. I show my hand to the fella beside me with a chuckle. He rolls his eyes, poor bastard probably has never seen quads in his life. Hoodie decides to chirp up even though he just got schooled. 

""You ever heard of GTO old man?"" This young punk must think I'm senile. ""I drove a Pontiac GTO in the 70s you clown. What do you drive?"" He laughs out loud again, this clown has lost the plot. 

Bev hums across the floor with the closest thing I've seen to a smile in years. ""I hit the Jackpot honey! $6k!"" It warms my heart to see that joy again, even if it's cost me an arm and a leg. ""Me and the girls are going for cocktails, give me your card?"" 

""Sure honey"" I say and hand it over. ""How about you top up my stack?"" Her usual sneer returns and she snatches my satchel, grabs my card, and the extra cash I withdrew for good measure. She hums away, and I catch Tom the dealer staring. ""Get your fucking eyes back on the table asshole before I jam a boot up your ass"". No fucking manners in this place, I guess not much has changed.",1601422711

10253,Galfond Challenge #3- Where did it go wrong?,poker,"https://www.twitch.tv/henry_kilbane

The Galfond Challenge started with an immense amount of hype and a crazy opener, with PG going down over 50 buy ins against Venividi before clawing back and winning by less then 1/2 of a buy in in the final session. Though the viewership was never insane aside from the final, they consistently pulled 1-2k viewers and had a fairly organized stream by the end of it. This included strong commentators, real time updates on hands/ profits and bonus incentives to play on RIO.

The second challenge featured Actionfreak; considered one of the best at HUPLO. Though the challenge was initially on RIO they quickly moved to Partypoker because of liquidity issues. Viewership saw a decline as well as overall stream quality, in part because the updates and graphs as well as bonuses that were available on RIO were no longer there. This second challenge didn’t have as consistent as a schedule and lacked the huge swings we saw in the initial opener, though PG was able to secure another win. Important to note that the stakes here were actually bigger, playing 150/300 instead of the normal 100/200.

Ignoring some random days playing Bill Perkins and Jungleman, we are now in the heat of the 3rd challenge against Chance Kournouth. 

Amazingly, the streams have been a. Not on RIO and b. Usually been pulling sub 100 viewers. Today’s stream required me to go to Phil’s twitter and find the stream link. Or you could go to the poker twitch section and scroll to the 16th most watched channel, behind reruns of 10-year old cash games, $5 MTTs and 25nl cash bankroll challenges.

How does RIO botch this challenge so badly? They have one of the best PLO/ HUPLO players playing 100/200 with a $1m side bet and the stream quality has declined, and failed to appeal to any but the most dedicated viewers. Maybe it’s just a function of too many hands, or lack of interest in HUPLO- but personally I find the stream tough to watch without player cams, hold cards or more colorful commentating.",1601408659

&amp;#x200B;

Villain seemed to be a competent player, who I had no particular reads on or history with as I hadn't played a hand with him.

Preflop play is pretty standard, wanting to isolate the limper and get heads up against them.

On the flop I decide to protect my checking/check raising range by having some triple barrel candidates in my checks so my checks are not just marginal hands and air, and I think aces are a good hand to check as I am likely far ahead of my opponents limp-calling range, and seeing another card could help him catch up if he chooses to check behind. I think his bet on the flop is heavily weighted towards stronger value hands as he should be very cautious of my isolating range even after a check, however he could be doing this with his single paired hands or his draws, thinking that I have wiffed with a hand like 77s or Ax with no flush draw. I elect to check raise 3x to get value from these weaker holdings of which some should continue, although I did acknowledge he can have us crushed with a hand like two pair, as he can have all of the two pairs where as I cannot although I think he is unlikely to have any sets in his limp calling range. Having the ace of hearts here is slightly concerning as it removes a lot of the bluffs that he would take this line with. 

On the turn I elect to check as I am OOP and some of his straight draws do get there. I think in this spot I should have bet (or even moved all in) however I would have been put in a terrible position vs a shove if I was to bet 66% or overbet the pot. His bet sizing on the turn of about half pot is very suspicious as I think he should be shoving most of his hands if he is going to bet at all with the SPR getting shorter. I do think this sizing is very value heavy, and he could be trying to keep me in the hand if I have a marginal holdings or draws that would bluff the flop, find a call vs a small bet on the turn but would fold to a jam.

The river is basically a brick and we continue the line we took on prior streets with a check. We would be happy if the villain checks behind here which I would expect him to do with his bluffs when the river bricks. Villain moves all in. I think Villains shove on the river along with his suspicious half pot bet on the turn is very indicative of a flopped two pair or a turned straight. I think we could have led this river with a small block bet of around 25% pot to try and avoid the tough spot we faced vs a jam after we check.

10290,Justifying using Uber so you can play online poker,poker,"I think I have hit true degenerate status.  

I had an unusual Uber experience.  My car was getting repaired.  I was playing online when my Uber arrived but my phone was nearly dead and I left my charger in my car.  The Uber driver fortunately had one but it was really short.

I have taken hundred of Ubers and Lyfts.  I was going to ask something I have avoided my entire life.  “Can I use your charger and sit in the front seat with you?  I know there’s a pandemic.  I promise you I don’t have COVID-19.  This is sort of an emergency.  I am in the middle of a poker game.”

He told me no problem.  I got into the passenger seat and played poker.  He asked me what game it was and was my strategy.  He knew a little bit about it.  Cool.

I kept him updated on my hands.  I said would tip him 10% of whatever I made.

I ran pretty well and cleared $70.  I gave him a $7 tip as promised.

And then me, being educated and having an IQ over 100, realized this was a profitable venture.  The ride was $17, so I made $53 (not including the poker tip).  And I didn’t have to drive.  It got me thinking why wouldn’t I do this every time?

I have 100% confidence in my abilities to make more money playing poker than Uber charges me.  I accidentally hit the Uber Premium button two days ago.  A guy in a brand new Tesla shows up.  I knew this was costly.  

I focused and played rock solid poker on the drive.  I won $90 and the ride cost $68.  I didn’t tip the driver this time on my winnings. 

Then again, it might put too much pressure on my poker game.  I feel I have to win on the Uber ride or else.

I live near a border town where there are a couple different home/card rooms. I try to play about 1 game every 2 weeks or so. But every time I go, I am astounded at how toxic the players are and the drama that unfolds. Between dealers who are emotionally involved in the cash game hands. to Players  who are not in an active session touching others peoples chips and the fucking beggars. 

Couple of scenarios that happened this week. A woman who clearly has a problem with gambling sits on the sideline of a 1/3 game. Proceeds to grab a stack of 100 dollars worth of chips on another players stack put them in front of her and proceeds to try to play. 

A Dealer who in my opinion is bottom of the barrel. Offers his opinions on boards mid-hand and comments on really connected nutted boards. Occasionally flashes burn cards, this one burns me the most because I was involved in the hand and it cost me money. 

Clear cases of people being too drunk and being toxic in the game. 

People folding out of turn constantly drastically changing the dynamic of a person decision to call all-ins and large bets. 

Non-poker participants hanging around outside of the building. I took a work call, and some guy approaches me on the sidewalk and mouths verbal aggression towards me. Cops are called on him for another incident and this guy proceeds to come at me while I'm still on the work call.

Coming in to the final table I was the second shortest stack, and it stayed that way throughout the final table where there was two large stacks (\~50bb) and a lot of shorter stacks (\~15bb)

1st: 900$

2nd: 450$

3rd: 300$

4th: 30$

***Hand #1***

The first hand is a questionable raise I made shortly after my fellow short-stack twin doubled in size and I was very short. 

D: 19 BB

SB: 52 BB

BB: VILLAIN: 10 BB

CO: HERO: 4.5 BB Hand A4ss

It goes fold, fold and BB calls with 5s5d

Runs out without a six and with an ace on the turn, lucky break and I am no longer holding the grenade at the table.

**Question:** Am I wrong to push in this spot, is it better to “blind-down” or wait for a premium to push and hope Villain goes faster than me.

&amp;#x200B;

***Hand #2***

This hand is a situation where I was very happy to sit in the BB with a nice hand, but I was annoyed that the hand did not come earlier. Given the smaller stack I could not face two raises, and probably should fold even to one?

Took $300 buyin and got it up to $450 after 3 hours. Not sure how good that is but I was pleased. Lots of limp/call that I consistently made 3x BB.

The table broke so they moved me to another table. Right away, I notice some things. The guy to my left has 6 stacks of red to my left. The guy on my right has 9 ($300 max buyin). Another guy has 7, and there’s one guy mad tilting, spewing angrily and I think that’s the guy to play against. And I was right, but everyone else is playing this like a $5/10 game. No limping and lots of betting, 3-4 bets. Average PF action is 3-4 players with $45-80 in the pot. 

Big stack is limping AA, KK and betting 78s. I think normally these guys don’t play well, but he’s crushing it. Of course, I’m not doing great and now one of the big stacks to my right makes a seat change to my immediate left and now all warning bells are going off. 

My best hand is one I call a $130 river bet and chop tptk. I thought about switching tables but I thought the experience would be beneficial so I stayed until I lost my profit about an hour later.  Then I just went home. 

I’ve only played live cash games a handful of times and I really want to get better, so if this happens again, is it okay to switch to another table and hope it’s softer, or tighten up and play the sharks?",1601300214

10335,Played in a massive game with fish.. then the table broke.,poker,"Hey guys.. just wanna start off by saying I’m just coming on here to talk about a situation I was in tonight. Not really sure what feedback I’m expecting, if any. I’m not complaining either .. just wanna see what the community has to say. Here it goes. 

Sooo.. I was playing in a 1/2NLH home game tonight. Considering the blinds it was a pretty big game. 9 handed and people were in for multiple bullets so the total value on the table was at maybe 4000. 

I was super card dead for the first 2 hours. Within this 2 hour period I went down about 200. And topped up for the max and grinded to get up 50. 

At this point i pick up kk and open UTG to 5x. middle position 3bets to 25, button flats, I 4bet to 50. Both players call. At this point I’m honestly thrilled. I figure they both have Ax and are blocking each others outs or a lower pocket pair. Flop comes 33q rainbow. I donk for 50. MP folds and button Jams for 135. He can maybe have QQ but also would just probably jam that preflop most of the time. Aces and kings are out of the question. What 3 does he have in his range? Literally no 3. I mean maybe 33 maybe A3s but cmon. I figure he’s got AQ or AK. Anyways I obviously call and he had A3o. siiiiick. 

Normally I would literally not care at all. I’m down ~200 but I can make that back and tons more in 1.5 hours against this table where people CALL 4BETS with A3o multiway. 

HOWEVER, in this case literally 15 minutes after this hand 2 guys who are buddies leave and then a couple more leave and then the table breaks. 

Bottom line is I’m not even annoying at the fact of the cards. I’m annoyed the table broke when it did. These fish had coolered a couple stronger players (there’s 4 strong players at this table) earlier in the night and the money was for the TAKING. 

All I can tell myself is it’s okay that they won cause they’ll be back for more.

10336,How to know when to move up in stakes?,poker,"I’m new to poker so I’m hoping someone on here can give a fish some advice. I’ve been playing 0.15/0.30 online poker for about a month now and I’ve doubled the amount i originally deposited in my gaming account. 

The thing is though there tends to be a lot crazy wild swings as opposed to “consistent upward trends”. The most apt analogy I can thing off is if you saw my account balance visually represented on a line you’d think it’d be the market price for a pretty volatile stock.

I just can’t tell if variance like this is something to expect from the game or if I’m just running on a hot streak. Just last night alone I had my set cracked by a straight made on the turn to lose (200BB) only to then win 350BB myself a few hours later by making a full house on the river. 

When would be a good time to move up in stakes? Are swings like this “normal” in the game of No Limit Hold’em? Should I build my account balance up a bit more? If so to what point? 

I now have ~460$ in my account and almost exclusively play 0.15/0.30. The next level up is 0.25/0.50.",1601275302

I get that feeling every few months when a guy rubs me the wrong way and I guess you would call it a leak of mine for sure...can anyone relate? Think I lost about 700 that hand.

10343,Poker trip report,poker,"I decided on a last minute whim to play the Venetian 100k this weekend.   I planned on entering flight 1C on Friday and to my surprise, I was alternate 180 at around noon.  The tournament was around 200 capacity with no rooms for more because the cash games were going and was told to come back an hour later to check if I would be next.  4 o'clock rolls around and the tournament director isn't even close to calling my number.  The blinds were 300/600 with 600 BB ante, and I de-registered and got my money back.  I asked the cage personnel if I can register for flight 1D, and to my surprise they said no, and to come around at 8 in the morning to wait in line.  

After getting my money back, I drove over to the Bellagio and played in a mix game that consisted of stud 8 and super stud 8.   Cindy Violet was playing and running bad, and Chau Giang sat down for a brief moment not playing a single hand and leaving quickly.  I played in the game for 14 hours and was down $485 and decided to call it a session.  Bellagio poker room was not filled to the brim and my game was tucked in the corner closest to the cage.  

I drove back to the Venetian at 7 am and got my $300 free play chips from the casino cage, and proceeded to run the free money up to $1000 real money on the blackjack tables.  At around 8 am, I colored up and went to line up at the poker room.  The line was already 50 deep and registration doesn't open til 9 am.  By the time 9 am roll around the line has already stretched around the huge electronic baccarat tables and pass the Asian noodle restaurant.  I registered and went back to my hotel room for shower and a 2 hour nap.  

I woke up at 10:45 am, and ate a breakfast sandwich I had gotten before going to my room. I got to my seat at 11:05 and the tournament has just started.  Room was very packed, you could not lift up your elbows without bumping into someone.  Players at my table were filthy casuals who called preflop with 75% ranges,  and I was able to double up my stack at level 2.  Someone even called my pot size river bet with 95 high because they thought I was bluffing on a board KQ843,  I was, but I had A9.  At level 6, I lost a few flips, and a cooler spot where I had top 2 vs a turned straight.  I went to my room to sleep for the rest of the day.  

TLDR: 

Venetian : Poker room is cramped, but the competition is very weak.  I got a free bottle of white wine and $300 free play chips to stay there.

Bellegio: Poker room had a lot of space. Saw semi famous poker players. 

Vegas: Mask were mandatory everywhere, a lot of people wore them incorrectly.  No smoking at the blackjack tables. Strip is sketchier than normal, saw homeless lady in the Venetian fountains skimming for change.",1601268422

10345,Best Cities for a 1/3 - 2/5 NL cash game grinder (redux),poker,"Piggybacking off of this thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/323yek/best_cities_for_a_25_510_nl_grinder/ which had a ton of great information.

I am currently in NOLA playing poker at Harrahs, but they only have 1/3 and the games are 5-handed.  They are seemingly the only major city still in phase 2 of Covid although that may change in a few days.  The games are juicy here I guess although i don't have much to compare them to as I've been dormant for the past few years.  I have earned &gt;$30/hour playing 1/3 so far in about 50 hours here though and I believe I have been receiving below-average holdings pre-flop overall so there might be some more run-good in the near future. 

My schedule is open and I'd like to grind poker for a month or two.  I was in Scottsdale a few weeks ago and Talking Stick was fantastic, but the accomodations close to the casino are a tad too expensive for my liking and now I'm out further east.  I was in Texas for a few weeks looking at houses but I didn't play.  I like to be able to live &lt;1mi from the casino for $1k/mo rent or less or a vicinity with cheap real estate.  

FWIW There's a nice hostel here in NOLA down St. Charles that has bunks for ~$30/ni and theres usually only one other person in my 4 bunk-room, although 3 nights out of 9 I was alone in my room - which was obviously great.  Regrettably they only allow 2-week per year maximum stay so I need to look elsewhere.  

I may want to move up to $2/5 but I don't really know where the juiciest games are in a relatively inexpensive city.  BravoPoker wasn't updating as much afaik due to covid etc, Harrahs NOLA was shown as closed on there last I checked even though they've been running for weeks/months.  

Would love to hear how the $2/5 games are anywhere in the SE USA or anywhere else.",1601264597

10355,"Interesting spot in nl 0,5/0,5 live",poker,"First some background, as we have some unusual dynamics in the game. There's a huge fish in the game, and me and another player go quite far to exploit him. We also have been playing a lot (like over 500 hours within the year) together so we know quite well how the other plays. Or so I thought at least, I've been on the receiving end of some coolers lately, so I would like some opinions on this hand that I thought was interesting.

The game is 6 handed, we're on the button with 95 of clubs and we have both the villain and the fish covered with ~100€ behind, the huge fish is on small blind, and our villain (with like 95€), the reg that I've been playing with a lot, opens to 3,5€.

My first thought is that this is exploitative raise size for him, and I think I'm quite confident putting him on quite a strong range (like AQ+, 88+). What does hero do?

So, basically can we call here? We're going against a really strong range, but we do have quite good implied odds, and if I'm correct on his range being this narrow, I think I can exploit that on many boards, right? Also, the fish is most likely to be entering the pot as well, so I'm quite confident. But not sure, is this a fold?

Anyway, I called, both blinds fold, and the flop is

Q95ss (no bd fd for me)

Villain bets 5€,(pot 8€) and we have a mandatory raise here right? We want money in quickly with two pair, and there's a ton of turns that could hurt us (either villain makes the best hand, or kills our action). I would think villain also stacks here with AQ, although lately I'm not sure. What should be our raise size?

I raise to 22€, and I would do this with all two pair (of which I have all the suited combos), all combo draws other than pair +fd, of which I have plenty: KT, KJ, JT, J8, T8 and sets I have (99, 55). Is this reasonable when I expect villain to bet this flop most of the time, Maybe checking hands like JJ, TT, and maybe if he has it (don't think so), AJ. Villain calls. The turn :

8, that opens a second flush draw.

Villain checks, and we bet 28€ (pot 52€), and villain raises all in for ~70€. We snap this right? Or am I crazy?",1601251490

10393,Idea: Ranked play money heads up,poker,"I don’t really play play money but I was thinking the other day about how there is no real place to play for people that are actually good at poker, with play money. So my question for people that do is, what do you think about a ranked heads up system where you only face off against people near your specific skill level? Kind of like how hearthstone does it. Obviously would be a struggle getting a regular player pool, just thought I would figure out whether people actually want it before investing my time or money in to the idea.",1601204495
10394,Can I get some help with chip denominations and blinds?,poker,"Playing a friendly game between friends (4 of us) and I’m struggling to figure out the best way to divvy up the chips as my set only has 4 different colours. 

Two colours have 100 chips and two have 150, I’m currently thinking 25/50/100/500 Worth the blinds starting at 25/50, but I’ve no idea of how many of each to give to each player",1601203254

10396,MP who reshoved had 100+BB and i had 70BB on the BB. I felt that he was going to iso-jam with alot of hands that im dominating and i personally felt like this was a good spot to get a huge stack. My friend think that i should not be risking my 70BB stack and it is marginal. SO am i fish here?,poker,,1601197576
10397,What do you do in this situation,poker,"I have AdQd in middle position (6 person cash game). UTG raises to 3bb.
I 3 bet to 6 bb
Cutoff calls and UTG calls
Flop is A A 2 rainbow
UTG bets 18 bb 
I raise him to 54 bb
Cutoff calls and UTG calls (is a shove because his stack was 55bb)
Turn is a K
I check to cutoff who bets 75bb
I ship it for 30bb more than the 75bb and he shows me the bad news...
Pocket 2s
UTG had A J and the river is a brick.


Where did I make the mistake? Raising him on the flop?

Could I have folded the turn?",1601192473
10398,HUNL against an opponent who always seems to have it,poker,"Any tips for HUNL against an opponent who seems to have your measure?

Theres one opponent who I just can't seem to beat. I play premium hands aggressively against him but he always seems to have it. Whether its a better kicker or sucking out with a full house on my staight or rivering a straight on my 2 pair.

I need to change the way I play against him but im out of ideas... Ive tried playing only premium hands, tried loosening up... Any advice on how to improve my game against him?

He's made me his bitch lol just wanna see if anyone has any tips on what I need to do to improve my outcomes against him.

Against others i can crush them but for some reason i cant land a blow on this guy.

In tournaments i can get him but HUNL i don't get close",1601191875
10399,Heads-Up Advice.,poker,"Hey everyone, so i’m a casual poker player, but I really enjoy the game. I mostly play home games with friends (who are really competitive and are also good players— no fish really). I also play a little online. Anyways, my biggest weakness in my game is heads up by far. like not even close. When we play tournament home games, I make the last 2 almost 90% of the time. Yet, I tend to lose quite often because of my heads up game. Anyone have any advice on how to get better? I know youtube has hundreds of videos, but that is a lot of info to digest. So, where would you start when trying to learn how to really improve your heads up game? I know basic strategy and it’s not like i’m totally incompetent, but i’m just tired of losing more often than not. Any tips?",1601184366
